ENRON EMAIL CLASSIFICATION

1. The Enron email corpus is rife of research opportunities in the fields of data mining and machine learning. It is a dataset that consists of
500,000 emails of real employees from the now bankrupt Enron Corporation, over a span of 3.5 years.

2. Specifically my research attempts to answer the following question:

Can the proposed methodology of analyzing email content of the top six executives be used for future attempts at revealing patterns of corporate fraud? 

Specifically focusing on these six individuals - 

Sally Beck (Chief Operating Officer),

Darren Farmer (Logistics Manager), 

Vincent Kaminski(Head of Quantitative Modeling Group), 

Louise Kitchen (President of EnronOnline), 

Michelle Lokay (Administrative Assistant) and 

Richardsanders (Assistant General Counsel).
