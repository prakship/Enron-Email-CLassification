Competition Bureau Raided Enron, Powerex Offices, Paper Says
11/23/0 9:44 (New York)


     Toronto, Nov. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Canada's Competition Bureau
raided offices at Powerex Corp. and the Canadian arm of Enron
Corp., alleging the companies conspired to raise electricity
prices, the Globe and Mail reported, citing officials from both
companies.
     The bureau obtained a search warrant in May, claiming the two
companies co-ordinated bids last year to drive up prices on
Alberta's central electricity exchange, the paper said. Both
Powerex and Enron Canada Corp. said charges haven't been laid, and
denied they had broken any laws.
     Competition Bureau officials didn't say whether the
investigation is continuing. Unnamed sources told the paper the
bureau ``is keeping an eye on'' electricity markets in British
Columbia, Alberta and Ontario as those provinces deregulate.
     On Nov. 16, Houston-based Enron, the world's biggest energy
trader, said it plans to sell a 15 percent stake in a key Indian
power project valued at $136 million.
     Powerex is the power-marketing subsidiary of the British
Columbia Hydro and Power Authority.

(Globe and Mail, B1, 11/23)
Report on Business: Canadian 
Competition cops raided power firms Evidence of electricity price fixing 
sought in Enron , Powerex offices, warrant shows 
LILY NGUYEN AND PETER KENNEDY 
? 
11/23/2000 
The Globe and Mail 
Metro 
Page B1 
All material copyright Thomson Canada Limited or its licensors. All rights 
reserved. 
The offices of Enron Canada Corp. and Powerex Corp. were raided this year by 
the federal Competition Bureau, which was investigating suspected price 
fixing by the two companies. 
In a search warrant application last May, the bureau alleged that in the 
summer of 1999, Enron and Powerex co-ordinated bids to drive up the price of 
electricity on the Power Pool of Alberta, the province's central electricity 
exchange, Dow Jones reported. 
Both companies confirmed searches were carried out, but said no charges have 
been laid and denied breaking any laws. 
Eric Thode, a spokesman for Enron Corp. in Houston, which owns Calgary-based 
Enron Canada, said the bureau has since returned all of Enron 's files. 
Mr. Thode added the bureau has called Enron only once with a question about 
the files. ""It remains just allegations,"" he said. 
""We are confident that all of our activities have been in the rules of the 
Power Pool of Alberta and within applicable Canadian laws."" 
Both he and Wayne Cousins, a spokesman for Powerex, the trading arm of 
British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority,said they didn't know if their 
companies are still being investigated. 
""Powerex is confident that the bureau's investigation will find that the 
company has not violated the rules of the Alberta Power Pool,"" Mr. Cousins 
said. 
A spokesman from the Competition Bureau was not immediately available to 
confirm whether the investigation is continuing, but sources close to the 
bureau said it has been keeping an eye on the electricity markets in British 
Columbia, Alberta and Ontario as those provinces deregulate. 
While most of the bureau's monitoring has been in the form of advice, the 
regulator has taken steps for more direct intervention, sources said. 
Deregulation of the electricity market is still new and the market is not 
established, giving companies in the sector ample opportunity to play with 
the system, sources said. 
According to the search warrant, the bureau began investigating the two 
companies when Power Pool of Alberta system controllers noticed the price for 
a megawatt of electricity frequently rose above $100. 
In the Alberta system, participants submit bids to buy or sell power for the 
following day, and the price per megawatt of power is set by the most 
expensive unit needed to meet demand. 
Until the Power Pool changed its rules on Oct. 20, 1999, a participant could 
change the amount of power it bid or offered up until 20 minutes before the 
hour of transmission. The search warrant covers the companies' actions from 
June 1, 1999, to Oct. 19, 1999. 
Mr. Thode said investigations of this nature are common in deregulating 
markets. 
""It's happened in California this year, it's happened in the Midwest, it's 
happened around the globe. It's not unusual to see this type of investigation 
occur,"" he said. 
He added the Power Pool is required to call in the federal agency whenever 
there are allegations.

Bob,

I came across this new federal filing on case stream that I thought you might 
want to know about.  It looks like a breach of contract case filed against 
ECT and ENA in Judge Hoyt's court.

Let us know if you need any assistance with the defense of this matter as we 
would love to have the opportunity to show you our capabilities.  I've done 
some work for the litigation unit, but none yet for ECT or ENA.  From my 
previous conversations with Jim Derrick, I understand that we are approved 
for general litigation matters.  Also, I'd love the opportunity to work with 
you and/or Richard Sanders.

Best Regards,

John

P.S.

I saw that you and Elaine got your tree this weekend.  We are still on our 
quest for a tree after striking out at four different places yesterday.  
Where did you find yours?

Subject: Triple C Power v. Enron Development Corp. (269th Judicial District 
Court, Harris County)
PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT COMMUNICATION

 This morning I received a copy of the Summons, Petition and Request for 
Disclosure filed in the above-referenced case.  I have had a copy put on your 
desk. The CT Service of Process Transmittal Form indicates that Enron was 
served on January 4.  By my calculations, Enron's answer is due on January 
29. 
 The petition generally alleges that the plaintiff entered into a contract 
with Empressa Electrica de Guatemala, S.A  involving barges in the port of 
Puerto Quetzal in Guatemala.  Plaintiff further alleges that Enron assumed 
the plaintiff's position in this contract, expanded the project and failed to 
pay the pro rata amount allegedly due to plaintiff because of the expansion. 
 I think you had been working on a dispute involving Texas Ohio Power's 
claims pertaining to the Empressa PPA, the barges in Guatemala and expansions 
of that deal.  Is this lawsuit directly related?  If it's not directly 
related, is it related enough for us to use the same outside firm we used in 
the TOP dispute?  What outside counsel were we using for the Texas Ohio Power 
dispute?  Is this something you have time to work on?  If not, let me know 
and I'll be happy to handle it.  Thanks.

Below is a summary of our activities this past week

Accomplishments:
Delivered workshops at NEPCO
Gained agreement with NEPCO on status of showstopper reports
Scheduled India' s workshops for next week
Rolled out (to NEPCO) the user manuals developed


Upcoming:
Complete gathering of data points and begin to layout longer term strategy 
(Elaine and Kim)
Develop additional workshops (design and data flow, consolidations and 
intercompany)
Develop and deliver second evaluation
Roll out manuals to user group in Houston 


Where are we at?
We should be able to ask more specific questions in our follow up evaluation 
to get better data on what specifically they don't like about the reporting 
out of SAP but as a rule so far we have consistently heard the issue of 
management quality reports, ability to pull data from across modules (ie. HR 
and PS data) and I can't get the data the way I want to see it therefore I 
don't understand what the data is telling me. 

This last point will be helped by these workshops (ability to view the data 
in mulitple ways) but only to the extent where people use the tools available 
and spend a little time to work with the system.  The design sessions 
(upcoming) should help address some of these questions aswell - one big 
learning from this has been that the majority of users do not understand 
their business unit design or the overall design and therefore can't figure 
out what the system data is telling them.  This is being addressed in the 7/1 
training plan and will also be addressed in the long term reporting strategy.

Thanks, again if you have any questions please contact Melissa, Greg or 
myself.

I wanted to make sure you were aware of the current situation with Eletrobolt.  With respect to the current liquidity issues, we are working to extend the WestLB facility over year-end to give us cushion with respect to the OPIC financing.  The potential exposures depending on when WestLB has to be taken out, when OPIC funds and when equity syndication occurs is outlined below.  Please let me know what other questions I can answer or if you would like to discuss the specifics further.  My cell phone number is (5511) 9233-7428.

John:

We still do not have a deal with the government.  They have delayed giving us a written proposal over the last two weeks.  The latest is that they have said that they will give us something on Tuesday of next week.

With respect to the burn rate, we are projecting about $20 million in expenditures over the next month.  Our current investment is about $220 million.

I think you should also have a rough idea of how we are funding this and what the plan is over the next couple of months.  The investment is currently funded through an off-balance sheet / on-credit vehicle with WestLB.  The WestLB vehicle is structured to fund the plant through commercial operations.  The plan is to have the OPIC financing in place to take out the WestLB vehicle.  This would infer an approximate $95 million equity investment upon the take-out of the WestLB vehicle.  We are currently in the process of syndicating the equity.  We have one indicative proposal for 50% of the equity.  We hope to have another next week.

There are some specific timing issues that you need to be aware of.  WestLB did not want to take operating risk in the financing.  Our position with WestLB is that we do not reach  commercial operations until we reach the start date of the Petrobras contract.  We are currently producing energy into the grid.  At some point, WestLB could try to force us to take out the entire vehicle prior to the OPIC funding.  Depending upon the timing, this could represent a cash flow of up to $280 million for a short period of time.

Please let me know what other questions you have.

In Business This Week
A MERGER AHEAD FOR ENRON?

With its stock falling to new lows and its credit rating battered, energy giant Enron is desperately searching for new capital. Sources close to the Houston company say it's considering deals with other energy-trading companies, private-equity firms, and blue-chip saviors such as GE Capital. The Wall Street Journal and CNBC reported that Dynegy is in merger talks with Enron. The company's financial crisis was sparked by disclosures about some of its off-balance-sheet partnership deals negotiated by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. A Securities & Exchange Commission investigation and the threat of liabilities from shareholder lawsuits could make it tough for Enron to land a new investor.

See you in court

11/17/2001
The Economist
Copyright (C) 2001 The Economist; Source: World Reporter (TM) - FT McCarthy

The company's trials have just begun 
LAWYERS are swarming all over Enron's old financial statements and press releases in the hope of reaping huge fees from securities litigation. More than 20 class-action lawsuits have been filed in recent weeks, and new ones are popping up every day. A formal process has been started to consolidate litigation in Houston, where the troubled energy company is based, with all lawyers interested in the case required to stake their claims by December 21st.
The broadest accusations will be of fraud and material misstatement, legal ways of saying that the company's financial statements were garbage. This week, Enron's founder and chairman, Kenneth Lay, decided to forgo a severance package worth over $60m while admitting that the company's problems ""had been exacerbated by the extensive use of debt capital, both on and off the balance sheet"". America's Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is looking again at off-balance-sheet financing, having fretted about it on and off for a decade. 
There will also be charges of insider trading, because even as Enron was issuing securities amid glowing profits reports, top executives were dumping over $1 billion of Enron shares to ""unsuspecting investors"", a group that includes anybody who, however briefly, has held one of the company's 750m shares in the past two years. ""The number of class members will be huge,"" says Maurice Pesso, a lawyer at a New York firm that has filed a claim. 
There are, however, limits to the company's liability. It has already restated its results going back five years, but federal law restricts litigation to the past three. Moreover, Enron will not take the rap alone. Its auditor, Arthur Andersen (now plain Andersen), is also named as a defendant in at least one of the complaints already filed. The litigation comes after a rough decade for Andersen. It has had to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements after sloppy audits on such companies as Waste Management, Sunbeam and Discovery Zone. 
Because Enron evolved from an energy company into a financial firm, it became much like an unregulated bank. The lack of supervision meant that the role of the company's auditor was crucial. Andersen was certainly paid as if it was. In 2000, it collected $25m for auditing Enron's books and another $27m for consulting services. Now how do you account for that?

Did Ken Lay Understand What Was Happening at Enron?
By FLOYD NORRIS

c. 2001 New York Times Company

WHAT a tangled web was weaved by Enron. Both investors and managers seem to have been misled. 
''Enron became overleveraged,'' Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, said this week, adding that things went wrong in ways that ''I could not have ever contemplated.'' He pointed to investments that ''performed far worse than we ever could have imagined.''
That was the first time that Enron had admitted it had a leverage problem, and it came only after the brutal reality had become apparent to many others. Mr. Lay says he understood what was going on, but I suspect he had left crucial details to others who have since departed and did not fully grasp the reality that was obscured by Enron's soothing financial statements. 
When Enron was riding high, it could easily have sold stock to raise capital that it now desperately wants. Mr. Lay and other executives sold stock, but the company did not. Just a month ago, Mr. Lay spoke enthusiastically of how great the company's continuing earnings were. 
The leverage was not easy to find. A lot of it was carried off Enron's balance sheet. Partnerships and special-purpose entities that Enron set up borrowed money and funneled the cash to Enron. Enron guaranteed the debt but did not have to show it on its own balance sheet because it could meet its obligations by issuing stock. As undisclosed losses built up in those entities, it became more likely they could not pay their bills, leaving Enron to do so. 
It is also clear that the bond rating agencies did not understand Enron's plight until the last couple of weeks. When they figured it out, it took a $1.5 billion equity infusion that is part of the Dynegy takeover to keep Enron's rating above junk level. 
Now Enron has a board committee investigating various transactions, and promises to release details as they are uncovered. Officials speak as if they are learning what happened for the first time, and perhaps they are. Jeffrey Skilling, Mr. Lay's protege, was Enron's chief financial engineer until he quit this summer. And Enron's chief financial officer and treasurer were ousted as Enron unraveled. 
Some investors would say none of that matters now, that the only important fact is that Dynegy is buying Enron anyway. Chuck Watson, Dynegy's chief executive, is convinced that Enron's energy trading business is a gem that more than justifies the price Dynegy is paying. He figures the losses from the bad investments can be contained. 
The big question now may be whether Mr. Watson will retain his enthusiasm after his people study Enron's trading positions. Enron has always said it hedged its big derivative positions -- positions that can contain huge leverage that does not show up on the balance sheet -- but some of that hedging was with affiliated companies. If big surprises are found, Dynegy could back out of the deal. 
There is plenty of blame to go around here, and suits have been filed against Enron, its current and former officials, and its auditor, Arthur Andersen. But investors also bear responsibility. Enron's financial statements were, as Mr. Lay conceded this week, ''opaque and difficult to understand.'' Investors and analysts knew they did not know what was going on. They bought anyway. 
Enron was viewed as a company that always made its numbers. An old-line gas pipeline company had been transformed into a brilliant trader that could apply its magic around the world. Investors did not care how Enron made the numbers. Now, when it is too late, they do.

A Quick Change in Fortune Dulls the Glimmer of Houston
By JIM YARDLEY

11/16/2001
The New York Times
Page 14, Column 1
c. 2001 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, Nov. 15 -- On a day when oil prices plunged to two-year lows, when the hometown Enron Corporation continued its ugly free fall and when gloomy projections showed the local economy headed for a decidedly rough patch, George Alcorn lunched on Chilean sea bass at the downtown Petroleum Club and decided that the sky was not falling. 
''I've been an optimist all my life,'' said Mr. Alcorn, 69, who owns an independent exploration company and survived the oil bust years of the mid-1980's. ''The opportunities in this town have always been large. I don't think it's going to change at all.''
That Mr. Alcorn could sound upbeat in such seemingly grim economic times is hardly surprising in a city largely built on pluck and buoyant optimism. Until recently, economists had predicted that the economic downturn plaguing the rest of the nation would largely bypass Houston, the nation's energy capital. In June, The Economist magazine, citing Houston's increasingly diverse economy, even promoted it as a candidate for the world's next great international city and business center. 
But June is a long time ago. By then, the city had already lost 2,000 jobs from the struggling computer maker Compaq and will probably now lose thousands more if the company's merger with Hewlett-Packard is approved. In the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Continental Airlines, which is based here, announced 12,000 layoffs, some likely to come in Houston. The Texas Medical Center, one of the largest medical complexes in the world, is facing financial peril after flooding in June caused an estimated $2 billion in damages. 
The latest blow to the economy as well as the local psyche is the plight of Enron, the energy company that some analysts said tottered near bankruptcy before a merger with its local rival, Dynegy, was announced last week. Even if the merger goes through, the city is expected to feel a crunch; local real estate analysts say the merger could produce a glut of downtown office space at a time when new towers are under construction, including one by Enron. 
One visible symbol of the changing fortunes is that two of the city's sports stadiums, Enron Field and Compaq Center, are named for companies that soon may not exist. This week, the National Association of Purchasing Management, which measures business activity and industrial production, released a report showing that Houston's economy had contracted in October after 32 consecutive months of expansion. 
''Over the first half of this year, you had to feel pretty good,'' said Bill Gilmer, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and an authority on Houston. But Mr. Gilmer said that much of the city's recent job growth was driven by oil and gas companies and that the decline in prices meant the sector was ''running out of steam.'' 
''The national economy,'' Mr. Gilmer added, ''is not helping out right now.'' 
The fact that the ailing national economy is dragging on Houston is, oddly enough, evidence of the city's success in recovering from the 1980's oil bust. Then, with the local economy dominated by oil and gas, the drop in prices crushed the city and prompted civic leaders to preach economic diversification. And it worked: Compaq, Continental, the Texas Medical Center as well as dramatic growth in small business helped Houston recover and grow even faster, becoming the nation's fourth-largest city. The new generation of sophisticated energy companies, led by Enron, then created a boom. 
Economists say the next several months are likely to be slow. There could be substantial layoffs if Compaq and Enron mergers take place. Mr. Gilmer said the price of oil still played a large role in the city's economy; the number of exploration rigs has dropped to roughly 1,000 from about 1,300 in recent months. 
Yet no one is predicting a reprise of the bust, when downtown office buildings stood practically empty. Instead, economists point to a relatively quick rebound. Ray Perryman, a Texas economist who runs the Perryman Group, said Houston still had an infrastructure envied by most other cities, including the city's bustling port, the nation's second largest. The city was recently named as one of four finalists to become the American entry to be host of the 2012 Olympic Games. Voters recently approved construction of a starter light rail line, and federal environmental officials recently signed off on a plan to greatly reduce air pollution. 
''We're sitting here with over two million jobs,'' said former Mayor Bob Lanier. 
The downfall of Enron, though, a company whose value dropped almost 90 percent because of accounting problems and financial distress, has been the most highly publicized and unexpected blow to the city's economy. The company had embodied the self-image that Houston business leaders hold dear: it was entrepreneurial, aggressive and ground breaking. It was also a generous civic benefactor; the company's chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, a close friend of President Bush, had even been rumored as a potential mayoral candidate. 
But this week, Enron's lost glory became painfully evident. In a hall at Rice University on Tuesday, Mr. Lay presented Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, with a lifetime achievement award, the Enron Prize, which Mr. Lay's company had endowed and named in flush times. The next morning, an article in The Houston Chronicle said no decision had been made on whether the name of the prize would be changed.

Johnson and Longley Hurting Bottom Line
By Richard Sandomir

11/16/2001
The New York Times
Page 3, Column 5
c. 2001 New York Times Company

Larry Johnson and Luc Longley are gone from the Knicks' roster, but clearly not forgotten by their former employers at Cablevision. 
There will be no corporate tributes to Johnson, who retired, and Longley, who was waived. There will be no statues erected in their honor outside Madison Square Garden, a division of Cablevision.
But Johnson and Longley live on in Cablevision's third-quarter financial report, even though their names go unmentioned. The Garden has paid them the $48 million they had remaining on their contracts, then wrote them off because they are no longer performing for their money; the players lost the value they had when they first arrived at the Garden. Now they are nonperforming assets, not a small power forward and a bulky 7-foot-2-inch center. 
At least Johnson was, for a time after his acquisition in 1996, a key part of the team, even if his bad back kept him from scoring or rebounding as he had with the Charlotte Hornets. But the injured Longley's contribution last season was minuscule. 
So the Garden, which was hurt by fewer shows at the Garden and Radio City Music Hall, took a one-time hit and wrote off the value of Johnson's and Longley's contracts. For the third quarter, which ended Sept. 30, the Garden's operating cash-flow deficit was $32.4 million, compared with $29.6 million in operating cash flow last year for the same period. (Operating cash flow at Cablevision is defined as operating profit before depreciation and amortization.) 
Insurance will cover some of the cost of the Johnson-Longley payouts. 
''The team looks healthy,'' Jim Dolan, the president of Cablevision, said on Tuesday during a conference call with analysts. ''I don't expect any more write-offs.'' 
Whether that turns out to be true depends on whether any currently hearty player sustains a career-ending injury. But Cablevision could have avoided this financial circumstance had it paid attention to the physical conditions of Johnson and Longley. In each case, the Garden knew it was acquiring damaged goods. 
In his second season in Charlotte, Johnson hurt his back, and he has never been the same. Maybe the Garden was swayed that he was well enough, because he averaged 20.5 points and 8.4 rebounds in the season before it traded Anthony Mason for him. But the persistence of his back problems in the last few seasons attests to the riskiness of getting him in the first place. The back compromised his skills, often limiting him to being a symbol of the Knicks' grit. He also spelled ''L'' with his bended arm quite nicely, yet not worth an average of $7 million a year. 
When Longley arrived from Phoenix last year in the four-team deal that sent Patrick Ewing to Seattle, he said he had told the Knicks that he had a degenerative ankle condition. 
''I brought up my ankle in my physical with the Knicks,'' he said in July, ''and they said, 'Have you been playing?' I said, 'Yes,' and that was it.'' The fact was, he played for the Australian Olympic team in Sydney last year, but pain from his ankle kept him from practicing. 
Should have been a tip-off. 
The Naming Rights Dance 
Enron Field, home of the Houston home run, is bound to be called something different next season when Jimy Williams starts his tenure as the Astros' manager. 
Enron, the world's largest energy trader, agreed to pay $100 million to put its name on the ballpark for 30 years, a deal that began last year. But Enron is in trouble. It has lost nearly $60 billion in its market value; the company recently said it had overstated its profits for the past five years by nearly $600 million and it agreed to be acquired by Dynergy for $9 billion. 
In another part of Houston, the Compaq Center could take on another name now that the computer maker it was named for in 1997 (at $900,000 annually for six years) is planning to merge with Hewlett-Packard. In 2003, the Rockets will move to a new arena. 
Named stadiums and arenas have changed monikers before. A takeover turned Philadelphia's Comcast Center into the First Union Center. The TWA Dome in St. Louis is now the Dome at America's Center to reflect TWA's purchase by American Airlines. Marine Midland Arena in Buffalo now has HSBC's name. 
Meanwhile, Pro Player Stadium near Miami is named for a defunct division of the bankrupt Fruit of the Loom. 
Two other N.F.L. stadiums, one being built, the other three years old, are named for ailing companies. In Foxboro, Mass., CMGI Field is being readied for play next season by the New England Patriots. In the 12 months ended July 31, CMGI, an Internet development company, lost $4.4 billion (twice the annual network TV payments to the N.F.L.). CMGI will pay $114 million over 15 years for its naming deal -- if it lasts that long. 
PSInet, an Internet communications services provider that is paying $105.5 million over 20 years to be the name atop the Baltimore Ravens' stadium, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this year after losing $3.2 billion in the quarter ending March 31. 
The Conseco Fieldhouse in Indiana, the home of the Pacers, is named for a finance and insurance company that recently posted a $410 million quarterly loss. 
The financial state of some airlines since Sept. 11 may affect some of the arenas and stadiums named for them. Besides the dome in St. Louis, six other facilities are named for airlines (two for American). Last year, the Canadian Airlines Saddledome, where the Calgary Flames play, changed its name when its namesake went bankrupt and was bought by Air Canada. Now it is the Pengrowth Saddledome.

The Five Dumbest Things on Wall Street This Week
By K.C. Swanson <mailto:kcswanson@thestreet.com>
Staff Reporter
TheStreet.com
11/16/2001 07:22 AM EST
URL: <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/dumbest/10004082.html>

1. Fund Companies Gouge Investors
More gouging for clueless investors: Yet another fund company has said it will tack a sales charge onto its mutual funds. In December, Credit Suisse Warburg Pincus Funds will start selling its funds through brokers in a bid to attract more assets. 
The decision fits into a lamentable trend among fund companies adding sales charges to funds that previously had been sold directly. Others who've done it include Scudder, Strong and Invesco. 
Sure, it's no surprise that fund marketers are out to rack up more sales, and working through brokers is an easy way to do that (especially for funds with lousy reputations, which are less likely to attract direct investments without outside intervention). 
But that doesn't change the fact that load funds are almost always a rotten deal for investors. Legally, funds with loads are allowed to charge up to 8.5% of the initial investment in sales fees. 
In effect, paying a load reduces the size of an initial investment. When you consider the effects of compounding, that lost money could add up to a whopping amount in foregone returns over time. And now more than ever, investors can't afford to give up one iota of potential yields. 
2. Cipro Is No Savior for Bayer
A coda to the Cipro investment story, which we argued earlier was unconvincing: Sure enough, a recent earnings report from Bayer (BAYZY:OTC BB ADR - news - commentary) , the German chemical conglomerate that produces Cipro, shows that the company's other operational screwups more than outweighed the small gains it received from sales of the anti-anthrax drug. 
For its latest quarter, Bayer reported a loss of 183 million euros, compared with a profit of 534 million euros a year ago. 
The company acknowledged ""substantial"" extra business from Cipro shipments, including the U.S. government's order of 100 million tablets. But it said the additional sales were ""nowhere near enough to compensate"" for difficulties in other pharmaceutical lines, notably the damaging withdrawal of its cholesterol-lowering drug Lipobay/Baycal from the market in August after it was implicated in a number of deaths. 
Bayer's stock, which had dropped in the wake of the terrorist attacks, rose sharply as anthrax cases hit the news. From its low point on Sept. 21, the stock jumped 37.3% to its peak on Oct. 12. Since then, with anthrax fears abating and the news of disappointing earnings, the stock has lost 8.3%. 
3. Ken Lay, Playing It by the Book 
You almost have to admire the gall of Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) CEO Kenneth Lay, who, in exchange for presiding over the company's brisk slide into mayhem, tried to slip out the door with a $60.6 million pay package. 
He backed off that plan, according to press reports, on news that Enron employees were apoplectic about the deal. Some of them may lose their jobs in the merger with Dynegy (DYN:NYSE - news - commentary) , which came about after Enron's stock cratered on revelations about its fly-by-night accounting practices. 
To be sure, Lay's employment agreement had provided for the payout if he left the company within 60 days of a change in control. We can only assume that at the time it was drawn up, the agreement's authors didn't see the need to mention that he should leave the company in one piece. 
By the way, lest we convey the impression that Lay has acted cavalierly, he says he's put on his thinking cap lately. ""As might be expected, this is a very reflective time for me,"" he said on a merger-related conference call this week. We're a little skeptical of that claim, given that he said in the same call, ""We don't have anything to hide. Quite to the contrary, I think we've been very forthcoming."" Enron is currently under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission; fleeing investors have bid the stock down about 90% from its high last fall. 
4. A Blodget Blunder?
Speaking of folks who lost money for investors, analyst Henry Blodget is taking part in a buyout at Merrill Lynch, reportedly exiting the firm with a severance package of about $2 million. (Bwah-ha-ha-ha-ha.) 
Blodget won notoriety for talking up the prospects of many Internet issues that later went belly-up or were acquired on the cheap, including such resounding losers as Pets.com, PSINet and uBid. 
Last summer one irate investor, claiming he'd lost half a million dollars by taking Blodget's advice, extracted $400,000 in compensation from Merrill Lynch. 
But despite the lousy stock calls, in retrospect Blodget looks pretty smart. He cultivated a momentarily outsized (if short-lived) cult of personality -- worth doing once during a lifetime, in our humble opinion -- and secured a tidy payout on the way out the door. 
We note his exit from the scene not because he was dumb, but because his passage represents the end of an ignominiously silly era -- one in which ordinary investors tossed money into dubious ideas (like Pets.com), then were ungraceful enough to complain they'd gotten bad advice. There's no question analysts may have meted out absurdly bullish stock forecasts. The bigger problem is that investors, suckered by the potential of outlandish profits, acted like they believed them. 
5. Unflagging American Opportunists
While we salute the unflagging American entrepreneurial spirit, we note that it also can metamorphose into enthusiastic fraud. Such was the case with three opportunists flagged by the SEC this week: companies claiming to have products that protect against bioterrorism. 
Most inventive of the three was from R-Tec Technologies (RTTC.OB:OTC BB - news - commentary) , which claimed to have developed a ""Chemical and Biological Alarm and Neutralization Defense system,"" or in trumped-up military lingo, ""C-BAND."" The company said it's the first ""mechanically-operated"" (with a wind-up key in back?) system to protect citizens from such attacks. 
R-Tec has admitted that it's never tested the device, doesn't have any plans to manufacture it and doesn't actually hold a patent on it. But it gets bonus fraud points for the cool acronym. 
More straightforward scams were from Disease Sciences (DISE.OB:OTC BB - news - commentary) and The Classica Group (TCGI:Nasdaq SC - news - commentary) , which said they had technology capable of killing anthrax in the mail. Disease Science touted its ""High Pressure Pulse"" processing, a fairly intensive-sounding application that, the SEC notes, it does not have a license to use. The Classica Group's alleged microwave technology likewise got a thumbs-down from the SEC. 


GLOBAL INVESTING - Fidelity reveals a rise in its Enron exposure.

Fidelity, the world's largest mutual fund company, boosted its exposure to troubled energy trader Enron by about 20 per cent in the third quarter, just as the stock began to collapse amid regulatory scrutiny. 
In filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission released this week, the Boston-based company reported that it owned 20.8m shares of Enron on September 30 - up from 16.5m on June 30. The group reports its holdings with a two-month delay.
The filings do not detail the holdings of individual funds. The group's managers could also have sold some of their holdings since the filing period ended. 
Morningstar analyst Scott Cooley noted that even after the increase, assuming no shares had been sold, Fidelity would own about 3 per cent of Enron's outstanding shares, a small amount for such a large fund manager. With more than $800bn under management, the group holds sizeable positions in many companies. Mr Cooley said the increase was characteristic of Fidelity ""buying on the dip"". 
Enron shares began falling in September, as news emerged that the company's financial statements were more complex than investors realised, featuring several off-balance sheet partnerships, now under SEC investigation. 
Enron's shares plunged nearly 66 per cent in the fourth quarter.

FRONT PAGE - COMPANIES & MARKETS - HP and Compaq chiefs to forego $22m.
By SCOTT MORRISON.

FRONT PAGE - COMPANIES & MARKETS - HP and Compaq chiefs to forego $22m - Revelation comes amid shareholder concern over $24bn acquisition. 
The chief executives of Hewlett-Packard and Compaq Computer will forego more than $22m in retention bonuses to which they would be entitled if the agreed merger of their two companies goes ahead.
The revelation, contained in a regulatory filing on Thursday, comes amid widespread shareholder concern about HP's planned acquisition of Compaq for about $24bn. 
The sons of HP's two co-founders have criticised the deal, raising doubts that shareholders would back HP's takeover of its rival. Their opposition has prompted speculation that Carly Fiorina, HP's chief executive, would be forced out if the deal was voted down. 
She would have been entitled to receive retention bonuses totalling $8m, equal to double the sum of her current salary and target annual bonus. But she has declined to accept the right to participate in this programme. 
Michael Capellas, her counterpart at Compaq, was eligible to receive retention bonuses totaling $14.4m, equivalent to three times the sum of his current base salary and target annual bonus. 
Their decisions are shown in a so-called S-4 formal merger prospectus prepared by HP and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The filing outlines the managements' arguments for the merger. 
Despite Ms Fiorina's decision, HP has agreed to a retention payment programme for key executives that could total about $33m if all of them remain employed until payment of the second installment of their retention bonuses. In addition, Ms Fiorina and several other officials are negotiating new contracts that would give them higher salaries, the potential for bonuses and stock options. 
The compensation plan could cost as much as $22.4m if all key figures remain with the merged company for a certain period of time. 
The decision by Ms Fiorina and Mr Capellas comes after Ken Lay, chairman and chief executive of Enron, was prompted by shareholder outcry to announce he would not take the more than $60m he was entitled to after Enron agreed a rescue bid by rival energy group Dynegy. 
The S-4 noted that Walter Hewlett, the lone HP director who has opposed the combination, is a member of HP's compensation committee. 
Meanwhile, the US Federal Trade Commission has asked Hewlett-Packard and Compaq to provide them with additional information and other material concerning their proposed merger. While it is a standard regulatory practice, the companies warned that the request under federal law would in effect extend the waiting period for completion of the merger until August 30 next year. 
The S-4 did not provide a date for the shareholder votes required to consummate the $24bn deal. 
HP on Wednesday surprised the market by posting fiscal fourth quarter results that far exceeded analysts' expectations.

Stock drop cuts Enron retirement package

11/16/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - Employees of Portland General Electric are in shock after watching their retirement savings dry up along with the stock of energy giant Enron, PGE's parent company. 
The sting isn't helped by the fact that the selloff coincided with a lockdown that forced employees to hold the stock in their 401(k) retirement plans.
Stock prices have plummeted more than 70 percent since Oct. 16, when Enron announced a $618 million third-quarter loss. 
The loss stemmed largely from investment write-offs that led to the dismissal of the company's chief financial officer and now are being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
On Oct. 17, Houston-based Enron ""locked down"" the 401(k) accounts, meaning employees were not allowed to sell their Enron stock or make any other changes to their plans. The freeze lasted until Wednesday. 
Peggy Fowler, PGE chief executive officer, said the lockdown was the result of a long-planned change in retirement fund managers and acknowledged that ""the timing couldn't have been worse."" 
For 2,700 PGE employees with Enron 401(k) plans, the slump has decimated their nest eggs. 
""We couldn't get out, we just sat there and watched our nest eggs go down to nothing,"" said Roy Rinard, a PGE lineman from Boring with all of his 401(k) plan in Enron stock. Rinard, 54, said his account has dropped in value from more than $472,000 a year ago to $238,000 at the time of the freeze to about $70,000 now. 
""I just feel like I've been stolen from and lied to,"" said Alan Kaseweter, 43, a PGE service department employee who had almost all of his 401(k) invested in Enron stock. Kaseweter, of Redlands, said his account has dwindled from $348,000 a year ago to $115,500 at the time of the freeze to $36,000. 
Enron and PGE employees must accept Enron stock as the company's matching contribution to their 401(k) accounts. Only employees over 50 and retirees are allowed to roll it over to another investment. 
Enron seemed like a good bet. The stock climbed 475 percent between 1995 and Dec. 31, 2000. 
Enron purchased PGE in 1997, while it was reinventing itself into a cutting-edge energy trading company. It took staple products such as natural gas and electricity and attempted to trade them like other commodities. 
Reports surfaced about partnerships founded by Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. The partnerships borrowed money on Enron's behalf, which allowed Enron to keep the debt off its books. 
Fastow left the company, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission opened an investigation. 
On Nov. 8, Enron said it was restating earnings for the past five years, in effect admitting that it had inflated profits. 
At the same time, Enron froze employees' 401(k) accounts. Enron decided in July that it would hire new administrators for the retirement program. The changeover required about a month. 
Enron directors and executives dumped stock through much of the past 12 months, selling more than $136 million worth in all - a fact prominently mentioned in recent shareholder lawsuits against the company. 
Investors have also filed five lawsuits against Enron's executives and directors, including former PGE chief executive Kenneth L. Harrison.

(c) Telegraph Group Limited, London, 2001

INTERNATIONAL Power, the electricity generator spun off after last year's break-up of National Power, yesterday signalled it was limbering up for a fresh round of acquisitions. 
A number of companies in the markets where International operates are putting assets up for sale amid uncertainties about the power and financial outlook.
International is also keeping a close watch on developments at Enron, the American power generator and major market trader, in the throes of being rescued by rival Dynegy. 
Phil Cox, finance director, said: ""There are more opportunities opening up and we are looking at them. Our balance sheet is strong enough to accommodate the best of them."" 
International, with a generating portfolio spanning Europe, North America, the Middle East and Australia, produced pre-tax profits of #186m in the first nine months this year, compared with a loss of #80m in the corresponding period last year. 
The company has added five gas-fired plants to its America portfolio this year and hopes to get approval for two others in the state of New York. The shares rose 11 1/2 to 223 1/2 p.

India Dabhol Project Due Diligence To Start Next Week

11/16/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- Prospective buyers of the 85% foreign equity in India's 2,184-megawatt Dabhol Power Co. will start due diligence of the project next week, A.K. Doda, executive director of Industrial Development Bank of India (P.IDB), told Dow Jones Newswires Friday. 
The possible buyers are Tata Power Co. Ltd. (P.TPW) and BSES Ltd. (P.BSX)
""After the due diligence is completed, price negotiations will start and thereafter, the transfer of shares and transfer of ownership will take place,"" Doda said. 
U.S. energy company Enron Corp. (ENE) has a controlling 65% equity stake in Dabhol and wants to sell it because of payment defaults by the plant's sole customer - the Maharashtra State Electricity Board - and the Indian federal government's failure to honor payment guarantees. In August the U.S. company said it was willing to sell its equity at cost. 
Dabhol is India's largest single foreign investment to date. MSEB has 15%, while U.S.-based companies General Electric Co. (GE) and Bechtel (X.BTL) own 10% each in DPC. 
""The share price of the shareholding of Enron and its associates in DPC would be decided by the concerned parties, through mutual negotiations. Indian financial institutions propose to continue their efforts to ensure quick resolution of all issues at the earliest,"" Doda said. 
Doda denied local media reports saying that India's state-owned firm National Thermal Power Corp. (P.NTP) was also a potential buyer of the foreign equity in Dabhol. 
""So far, I am aware of only two companies - Tata Power and BSES. NTPC haven't sent us any expression of interest yet for the Dabhol project,"" he said.

Report on Business: Canadian
U.S. firms get in on Alaska pipeline
LILY NGUYEN

CALGARY -- Six powerhouse U.S. players are joining TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. and Westcoast Energy Inc. in an attempt to inject new momentum into a bid to build a multibillion-dollar pipeline from Alaska. 
The partnership, which includes energy services and transportation giants Williams Cos., Duke Energy Corp., Enron Corp., as well as major utilities El Paso Corp., PG&E Corp. and Sempra Energy Utilities Ventures,have agreed to work together with TransCanada and Westcoast to put a proposal before the Alaska gas producers before the end of the year. The group, which laid out its intentions in a memorandum of understanding signed yesterday, said they believe a gas pipeline running along the Alaska Highway can be built by 2008.
Murray Birch, senior vice-president of Westcoast, said the partners lend expertise, deep pockets and scale to the mammoth project, which is estimated to cost well over $10-billion (U.S.). 
""It's in our best interest to involve them. This project is a large project, and certainly Westcoast and TransCanada would have been stretched to do it by ourselves,"" said Mr. Birch, who is also the co-chief executive officer of Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd. a joint venture co-owned by Westcoast and TransCanada. Foothills holds the regulatory permits to the proposed Alaska Highway pipeline. 
Mr. Birch said the equity position of each company in the project is still to be worked out. Rocco Cianco, a Foothills spokesman, said that is in part because some of the companies are in a state of flux. Westcoast is in the process of being taken over by Duke, while Houston-based Enron is in the process of being bought by hometown rival Dynegy Corp. 
The partnership brings back to the table all nine of the original participants in a similar pipeline project that was proposed in the 1970s and shelved because of weakening commodity prices and native opposition. 
Mr. Birch noted that it also removes a legal question hanging over the pipeline project, of whether the six U.S. companies had any claim on the project based on their capital investment in the 1970s project. They withdrew from that project on the understanding that if it was to restart, they would be able to recover that initial investment, which some have pegged at up to $4-billion including interest, he said. In getting back on board, the six companies have agreed to waive that claim, he said. 
Scott Kent, the Minister of Economic Development for Yukon, a vocal proponent of the proposed pipeline, said the removal of the legal question lifts a huge barrier to the project. 
""There was a chance this could have ended up in a lengthy court battle that would have significantly hampered"" the project, he said. ""It's certainly very good news."" 
Winfried Fruehauf, an analyst at National Bank Financial in Toronto, said the six U.S. companies as well as Westcoast, TransCanada and Foothills are trying to make sure they're first in line to move the gas from burgeoning Alaskan fields to market. 
""Everybody and his and her uncle wants to be in this pipeline, there's so many 'me toos' that they just want to position themselves,"" he said. 
The market understanding is that the Alaska producers, which include Exxon Mobil Corp., Phillips Petroleum Co., BP Amoco PLC and Chevron Corp., will ultimately decide who will build and operate a pipeline because the cost of such a project would be recovered from them in the form of pipeline tolls. 
Gina Taylor, a spokeswoman for Enron, said the partners got together with an eye on approaching producers to get an answer from them on whether the project can go ahead. 
""Marketplace approval is key to us moving forward with this,"" she said. 
""That's why we put the [memorandum] in place, so we could go out and revisit with the producers."" 
But Curtis Thayer, a spokesman for the Alaska producers, said it is too early to talk about who will build or operate the pipeline, because his group has not even decided to proceed with one yet. 
He noted that a preliminary analysis done as part of a $100-million study the group has undertaken indicates a pipeline couldn't pay for itself at current commodity prices. 
However, no decision has been made, he insisted. 
Some of the other options floated include building a pipeline off the north shore of Alaska and Yukon to gas fields in the Northwest Territories, then down the Mackenzie Valley of the NWT, or a pipeline going over land in Yukon to the NWT. There are various backers for each proposal and the Alaskan producers have not ruled out undertaking a project themselves. 
Joe Handley, the Minister of Finance for the NWT, said news of the partnership is a spur to participants in the proposed Mackenzie Valley pipeline. 
The territory's government has consistently said an NWT pipeline must be built first or risk being derailed by an Alaska pipeline that would flood the market with product. 
""If we don't keep on our toes, [an Alaska pipeline] could pass us and leave us in the bush,"" he said. 
Foothills announced earlier this week that it reached a preliminary agreement with the Kaska Nation, removing another potential hurdle to the Alaska pipeline proposal.

New Power faults data flow but opposes program delay 
By LAURA GOLDBERG 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
The New Power Co., a major player in the state's test pilot of electricity deregulation, said Thursday that problems getting data from other entities have caused it to send out customer bills late and without all the appropriate charges. 
But New Power, an electricity provider, is hopeful problems can be resolved and doesn't believe the state should delay the planned Jan. 1 start of electricity deregulation. 
Delays and computer glitches have plagued the pilot program, which let a limited number of consumers across the state choose power providers before the opening of the full market. 
New Power and other electricity companies made comments Thursday in filings with the Public Utility Commission. The PUC will use them as it evaluates whether to move forward on Jan. 1. Several other companies also cited some ongoing problems. 
New Power, which enrolled more than 61,000 customers in the pilot, said a majority of its customers are getting late bills and that it has issued initial customer bills for lower amounts than what's due. 
Before New Power can issue accurate bills, it needs information from separate companies that maintain electricity transmission and metering systems. That information is sent to New Power through the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which runs a variety of computer systems need for deregulation. 
A New Power spokeswoman said executives have met with the companies and ERCOT about the problem and the situation seems to be improving. 
Reliant Resources, the Houston parent of electricity provider Reliant Energy Retail Services, said in its filing that it is ""confident that any remaining significant issues will be overcome"" in time to open the market Jan. 1. 
Near the end of last month, nine retail electricity providers told the PUC they opposed delaying the planned start date of deregulation. 
A coalition of consumer groups has called for a delay, saying the state isn't ready for a variety of reasons. 
But the electricity companies, which included Reliant and New Power, said the market shortcomings the consumer groups cited either don't exist or can be fixed and don't require a delay. 


Consortium's return sparks renewed hope in gas pipeline project
By MIKE CHAMBERS
Associated Press Writer

Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

JUNEAU (AP) - A natural gas consortium plans to resurrect its proposal to build a 1,700-mile gas pipeline through Alaska to the Lower 48, sparking renewed hope in the massive undertaking just as oil companies were doubting its viability. 
The nine American and Canadian companies announced plans on Thursday to offer to build and maintain the pipeline in an effort to ship 36 trillion cubic feet of North Slope natural gas.
The group intends to make a proposal to the three major oil companies by December, a spokesman for the consortium said. 
""The economic benefits of this multi-billion dollar project would impact most regions of the U.S. and Canada,"" said Mike Stewart, co-chief executive officer of Foothills Pipe Lines. 
Foothills reached the agreement with TransCanada PipeLines, Westcoast Energy and American companies Williams, Duke Energy, El Paso Corp., Enron, PG&E Corp. and Sempra Energy International. 
The groups comprise the original Alaskan Northwest Natural Gas Transportation Company which had first proposed building this project in the 1970s. 
Under the terms of the agreement, the companies plan to dismiss $4 billion in costs and interest associated with the dormant project that would have been charged to developers of the pipeline. The money represents their original investment, with interest. 
""Their intention is to remove that as an issue,"" said Foothills spokesman Rocco Ciancio. 
That was seen as a key roadblock to building an all-Alaska pipeline to the Lower 48 by officials with the state, which would own 12.5 percent of any natural gas pumped out of the North Slope. 
""Now that that's been resolved, it's time the producers come to the table with pipeline companies, the State of Alaska and other players to get this project underway,"" said Gov. Tony Knowles. 
Exxon Mobil, Phillips and BP have spent millions studying the viability of the project and, so far, have determined it is not profitable. 
Knowles and other state officials have been pressuring the oil companies to build a route that generally follows the trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline and the Alaska Highway to Alberta. 
It would provide jobs for Alaskans, cheap natural gas to communities and revenues for state services, Knowles said. 
But Canadian officials have pushed for a Beaufort Sea route that taps into rich reserves stranded in the Mackenzie Delta. 
The oil companies estimate the Canadian route would cost $15.1 billion compared to the Alaska Highway route, which would cost $17 billion. 
Ciancio said his group estimates a pipeline would cost $9.7 billion to construct and would get the natural gas to market quicker than other proposals. 
The consortium has held permits to build the all-Alaska route since 1976. 
""We're estimating it would take a greenfield (start up) project somewhere near two to three years to reach the same state of readiness as this project,"" Ciancio said. 
The consortium's project proposes running a 42-inch pipe from Prudhoe Bay to Alberta where the companies have other pipelines to ship natural gas to Chicago and San Francisco, he said. 
If agreements are reached quickly with the oil companies, the pipeline could be in operation by 2008, Ciancio said. 
A spokesman for the oil producers team which is studying the project greeted the news and said it would welcome any pipeline plan that would be profitable. 
""We're happy to see efforts being made to support an Alaska pipeline project,"" said Dave MacDowell, spokesman for the oil producer's group. ""We're absolutely open to folks coming forward with efficient economic projects.""

USA: Janus funds dumped EMC in third quarter.
By Christopher Noble

11/15/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOSTON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Mutual fund giant Janus Capital Corp. dumped 40 million shares of data storage leader EMC Corp. in the third quarter, cutting deeply into its stake in the one time high flyer while the company's stock plunged 59 percent. 
According to regulatory filings, Janus, a unit of Stilwell Financial Inc. ended the third quarter with 6.38 million shares in EMC, down from 46.44 million at the end of the second quarter.
Janus funds also cut storage software maker Veritas Software Co. , dropping nearly eight million shares in the quarter. But Janus added about 570,000 shares to its holding of Network Appliance , bringing it to 1.97 million shares. 
A spokeswoman for Janus declined to comment on the sale of EMC stock, but the company ran into trouble as revenue shrank due to stiffer competition and a steep downturn in corporate spending on information technology. 
Another big move was the sale of about 43.6 million shares of mobile phone maker Nokia . Janus ended the quarter with 183.2 million shares of Nokia, down from 226.8 million in the previous quarter, the filing showed. 
The filing shows more sales of technology companies but does not indicate a big move out of the tech sector the way previous quarterly data sometimes has. 
For instance, its second-quarter filing showed big moves out of many of the biggest names of the Internet revolution, including Cisco Systems , EMC, Oracle Corp and Sun Microsystems , the so-called ""four horsemen"" of the Web, that helped drive the expansion of the ""New Economy."" 
While Janus again cut sharply into its stake in Sun - dropping 14.7 million shares - its holdings of Cisco and Oracle were nearly unchanged in the quarter, the filing showed. 
Janus also cut about 12.6 million shares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. . On the other hand, the company added some 13.6 million shares of Microsoft Corp. and boosted its stakes in JDS Uniphase and EBay Inc. . 
The funds also more than doubled their holdings in Berkshire Hathaway Inc. to 320,691 shares. 
The filing showed that Janus made almost no change in the third quarter to its holding of Enron Corp. , the energy trading company whose stock collapsed amid a U.S. regulatory probe. At the end of the quarter, Janus held 41.36 million shares in Enron. 
The Janus spokeswoman would not comment on the Enron shares, but said that the filings are dated and don't necessarily reflect current holdings. 
Shares of Enron plunged in mid-October as investors rebelled over the company's off-the-balance-sheet deals that are now under investigation. 
Enron whose stock is off 63 percent so far in the fourth quarter. The company agreed last week to be acquired by smaller rival Dynegy Inc. for about $9 billion in stock. 
Janus's stake in Exxon Mobil Corp. more than doubled to 39.8 million shares in the quarter. 
Janus's stock holdings were worth $102.09 billion at the end of the quarter, down from $141.05 billion at the end of the second quarter.

Cash Infusion Little Comfort To Enron Counterparties
By Andrew Dowell
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/15/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- One and a half billion dollars doesn't go as far as it used to. 
Despite a cash injection of that size from Dynegy Inc. (DYN) this week, U.S. energy companies continue to restrict their dealings with Enron Corp. (ENE), traders in the U.S. power and natural gas markets said Wednesday.
Traders said they were doing deals with the Houston-based energy giant when necessary, and some reported that activity appears to have picked up. But traders said they were continuing to limit their exposure and doing business with other parties if possible until Enron's credit rating improves. 
""It's a company with one foot on a banana peel and one foot in the grave,"" said Ed Kennedy, a Miami-based trader with Pioneer Futures. 
Both Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's rate Enron one notch above speculative grade. Moody's has Enron's ratings on review for a downgrade, and S&P has Enron on negative credit watch. Enron's ability to do business in the energy markets depends on its maintaining investment-grade ratings. 
Tuesday's infusion of cash from Dynegy, which has agreed to buy Enron in a stock-swap currently worth about $10 billion, isn't enough to change the outlook for Enron, said Todd Shipman, a director in the U.S. utilities group at S&P. 
Instead, the firm will be watching to see whether Enron can hold on to its core business of trading North American gas and power. If it does, S&P may revisit Enron's credit-watch status after New Year's with an eye to upgrading it to ""positive,"" Shipman said. 
Circular Reasoning 

That sets up a staredown of sorts between the ratings agency and the energy markets, with each waiting for the other to take the first step. 
""It always has been a sort of face-off,"" Shipman said. ""For the time being, we're standing pat unless the situation at Enron gets significantly worse."" 
Moody's wasn't immediately available for comment. 
Traders and their companies said consistently that until Enron's credit ratings improve, they will continue to watch their exposure to Enron carefully, with trades limited to short-term deals. 
Mirant Corp. (MIR) is trading with Enron on ""a very limited basis"" that won't be broadened until Enron's credit situation improves, spokesman Chuck Griffin said. 
Aquila Corp. (ILA) CEO Keith Stamm said the company was heartened by Dynegy's injection of cash and was continuing to monitor Enron's condition. 
""The $1.5 billion has improved their situation with us, and we'll keep watching the situation,"" Stamm said. 
On Monday, Aquila said it had whittled down its exposure to Enron significantly. 
Enron spokesman Eric Thode said 30-day-moving-average volumes on EnronOnline, the Internet-based trading platform on which Enron is the counterparty in every deal, have improved to a more typical 5,700 transactions per day with a notional value of $2.7 billion. 
""Volumes have returned to the normal range,"" he said. 
Some traders said Enron's short-term business does appear to have picked up from earlier this week. 
Staffing Changes A Concern 

Enron is the country's largest trader of natural gas and electricity, accounting for up to a quarter of both markets by some estimates. 
Even when companies aren't prohibiting their traders from doing business with Enron, some traders are taking steps on their own to limit exposure. 
One funds analyst said the possibility of staffing changes at Enron are contributing to traders' reluctance to do business with the company. 
""You have headhunters out there,"" the analyst said. ""Why tie yourself down with a five-year deal with someone who may not be there?"" 
Enron currently employes about 1,500 people in its trading operation, and Dynegy employes some 300. The acquisition is expected to produce cuts, but Dynegy hasn't said to what degree. 
Energy companies began shying away from Enron over the past month, as concerns about its finances precipitated a 75% drop in its stock price and left its bonds trading at levels typically associated with distressed debt. 
Enron's restatement of four and a half years' worth of earnings last Thursday and ratings downgrades Friday led some companies to severely restrict their business with Enron, even if that meant paying higher prices or accepting lower bids to do so. 
Enron's ability to recover that business is critical to its future, S&P's Shipman said. A stable trading operation will keep Dynegy interested in the buyout, which is the key to keeping Enron's credit ratings out of junk-bond territory. 
""That's the crown jewel, and that's what Enron needs to protect,"" he said. If counterparties pull back, ""then I think we would have a little more cause for worry about the Dynegy deal.""

Dynegy May Want Some Of Enron's Broadband Assets
By Erwin Seba
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/15/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) may be planning to unwind its Broadband Services unit, but before it can do so, it may have to gain approval from its future new owner. 
Dynegy Inc. (DYN) is just beginning to look at which assets it wants to keep from Enron's non-core businesses.
""What we're saying at this point very, very early on is that we want to look and see if there are pieces of (the optical fiber network) that complement our strategy,"" Dynegy spokeswoman Jennifer Rosser told Dow Jones Newswires. ""And we're going to take the opportunity to review that."" 
One thing is clear, though: Enron is leaving the bandwidth market in which the company has been the principal market-maker. 
""I think we've made it pretty clear what our non-core businesses are,"" Enron Broadband Services spokeswoman Shelly Mansfield told Dow Jones. ""We're going to be exiting those businesses in an orderly fashion."" 
But Thursday morning Enron bandwidth traders said they haven't been told what will become of them. Many of them came to the bandwidth desk from the company's energy trading operations. 
""I've not been given any definitive information,"" a trader said. 
Traders and brokers who are counterparties to Enron said Enron's traders remain active in the bandwidth market, regularly showing prices for various contracts. 
Dynegy traders are also present in the market, but not as pervasively as Enron traders have been, said one broker. 
Dynegy's traders regularly show a high offer price without presenting a bid price, a broker said. Usually Dynegy traders will stay with that high offer expecting buyers in the market to come to them. 
Also, the broker said, Dynegy seems most active with contracts on the New York-Miami route. 
In addition to deciding what to do with Enron's network, Dynegy also faces decisions about whether to retain Enron's bandwidth traders and the contracts the company still holds for bandwidth services. 
Guiding Dynegy's decisions will be a continuing commitment to its own bandwidth strategy. 
""Dynegy has been focused on building very long-term customer relationships,"" Rosser said. ""We are focused, just as we have been in our energy business, on being a value-added provider to our customers. We have maintained a focus on the wholesale market...and large enterprise consumers of bandwidth. We have maintained focus on structured transactions and not trading, primarily because we don't think a true trading environment exists yet."" 
While Enron may attempt to sell its network in the nine to 12 months before the merger is completed, it may be unable to do so, brokers of physical assets and bandwidth said. 
Most optical networks are being broken up for sale, said physical assets brokers.

Director.   I hope everything continues to go well for you and you continue 
to enjoy meeting the challenges of our organization.

As you may know, some months ago I decided to re-establish my consulting 
business and have recently launced that new effort.  Please let me know if 
there is any way that I can be of help to you and your organization.  
Following is an overview of the firm's areas of specialty:

- Succession Planning/Executive Continuity
- Executive Development
- Organizational Development/Change
- Executive Counselling/Coaching
- Management Training
- Employee Surveys
- Innovation
- Leadership

Enron has requested a consulting contract and therefore I will continue to
work at my office here, as well as at my new offices mentioned above.
Therefore, you will likely be able to contact me at either location for the
next few months.

In my ten years of experience at Enron I have been responsible for
Intellectual Capital, Organization Development & Training, Executive
Development, etc. and I am looking forward to being able to continue to work 
directly with Enron and other companies interested in these areas.

Louise:

I am repsonsible for Middle Market Coverage for West Power in Portland.   We spoke a week or so ago re: the ENA/EES customer split methodology.  I will be in Houston next Monday and Tuesday (April 9/10).  I would like to spend a half hour or so with you, if you had time, to brief you on what's going in the Middle Market Group in Portland, reviewing year to date earnings and a market share analysis we recently completed.  You may be getting some info. from Tim and/or internal reports, but I figured, since I was going to be in Houston, it would be a good chance to fill in some details. 

I had asked John Lavorato if he wanted to meet, but he indicated (see below) that it would be more appropriate to meet with you.  Tim B. also indicated I should try to meet you as well.   Let me know if you would like to meet and what time works for you.

Thanks!

Chris

No - but they are probably a good candidate for the restructuring group.   They were originally 9 barges that were owned by CALME (D. Haug) and were being shopped around Enron for a home.   Some of them went to a power project in Nigeria and now their are two of them left without a home.  

Last year they were being considered for a LIPA deal on Long Island that was orginally proposed by R. Maffett/R. Tapscott.  Janet D. was working on this deal before she left for EES - but I don't think she made any further progress.  As I recall the ownership of the barges came from the CALME organization into Mike McConnell's - EGM group as part of the split of CALME assets.

Energy Services' (EES) business has grown dramatically and that requires 
considerable additional engineering and construction resources both to 
develop solutions for customers and to deliver those solutions to customers.  
Additionally, in light of Enron's continued emphasis on increasing our return 
on invested capital, we have been engaged in fewer large scale construction 
projects around the world.  Historically, these projects have been a primary 
focus of EECC's activities.  Consequently we are making the following 
organizational changes concerning EECC:

EECC's pipeline construction group, led by Jerry Martin, will become part of 
Enron Transportation Services.  
NEPCO will continue to operate as a stand alone entity focused on power plant 
construction services to Enron entities and third parties.
The remainder of EECC will become part of EES.  Larry Izzo will report to the 
EES Office of the Chairman.
 
 These changes will better align our intellectual capital with the growth 
opportunities within Enron and provide new and exciting opportunities for our 
employees.  Please join us in supporting and implementing these changes.",corporate,10,2000,19

Subject: Performance Review - Mid-Year

It's that time of the year again - just earlier this year than last year!!!  
Please log into the PEP system, when it becomes available, and select at 
least five feedback reviewers.  The feedback is intended to reflect 
interraction throughout the organization.  For leads and managers and 
directors, please make sure you include at least one direct report.  The 
reviewers you select should be employees whom you have worked with frequently 
since 1/1/00 and whom can provide constructive feedback as to your 
performance.  Nothing prevents you from selecting more than 5 reviewers.  I 
will review them, and if I feel there are others whom should be added, I will 
do so.  ASSUMING the system becomes available soon, please complete your 
selection process by COB, Tuesday, 5/16/00.  I want to approve these ASAP, so 
we can get our request out early.  Turn around is critical.

The next thing I will need is a listing of your accomplishments for 2000.  I 
would like these by E-Mail by Monday, June 5, 10:00am.  Once again, the 
timeline is critical to the process, and is not negotiable.

Although we have reorganized the Risk group effective 5/1/00, I will still 
perform the performance reviews.  Mike, Steve will be responsible for your 
review. 

Let me know if you hav any questions or concerns.  Thanks for supporting the 
process and the timeline!

Hi Louise.
I received this spreadsheet from Gemma Butler in London which shows all Director-level and above employees for EEL.
No filters are currently active, and all Female employees are at the top.

 << File: EEL Directors-Gender.xls >> 

Unfortunately, myself and Jean have limited knowledge of the people in the international offices.
Would you be able to identify possible candidates for us?
Here is a breakdown of the current state of the presentation...

Females:
8 Commercial, 1 EEL
6 CS/ ST, no EEL

Males:
10 Commercial, 4 EEL
6 CS/ST, no EEL (primarily have ST).

I think we need a few additional Commercial Females, and a few Male & Female CS candidates to give us a balanced portfolio.
Although I think the London office will be closed by the time I get the names to them today, we should have their data by early next week.
Also, I have included a spreadsheet which includes the career data for the employees Marcello Romano identified, as well as a few others.
There does not appear to be the type of candidates you are wanting, but i'll let you make the call.

Subject: Pricing Issue for 5/00 production - Duke Energy

Elizabeth,
Sorry, I can't remember if we had talked about this pricing issue or what.  
Were you looking into this issue  for me or was it passed to someone else.
Please see the email below.  I believe the system is pulling in the wrong 
price for WAHA.WTX.IF.M.I.. for 5/00 production.  The deal # is 250237.
 I looked at the publication and it shows that the price should be $2.95.  
The price of $2.95 plus $1 would equal the price of $2.96 which is what Duke 
is 
claiming the price to be instead of what we are showing which is $3.95.

Thanks, Stephanie ( 3-6004 )

Elizabeth,
I have a pricing discrepancy and I was not sure if I send this to you or 
Oneil.  
It's for Duke Energy, 5/00 production, deal # 250237.  Duke believes our 
price is too high.  The system downloaded a price of  $3.95 
The price should be WAHA.WTX.IF.M.I. , which is $2.95 for that month.  ( 
WAHA.WTX.IF.M.I. + 1 ) Duke believes we should have paid them $2.96.
I think the system pulled in the wrong price.  Could you please let me know 
if you handle this pricing issue or someone else?

 Two plaintiffs attorneys filed a class action complaint alleging

this was done by withholding capacity on the El Paso and Trans Western

Ron Carroll's Analysis of Private Cause of Action
 One of the assignments from our Portland meeting was to find out
whether or not there was a private right of action (or prohibition of same)
under the Federal Power Act.  Here is Ron Carroll's response:

 The courts have refused to create a private cause of action for
violations of the FPA, stating that the regulatory scheme created by
Congress vested the regulatory body with the power to pursue enforcement.
See Clark v. Gulf Oil Corp., 570 F.2d 1138, 1149 (1977) (pertaining to the
recovery of losses due to allegedly unlawful rates under the NGA); City of
Gainesville v. Florida Power & Light Co., 488 F. Supp. 1258, 1277-78 (S.D.
Fla. 1980) (noting that the legislative history of the NGA, which was
modeled after the FPA, does not suggest the existence of any private rights
of action).

Data Preservation
 Steve Hall and others have been working on making sure that the
California AG's request to preserve evidence has been complied with.  EPMI
will probably be extending the period that it keeps backup tapes, making
copies of hard drives from individual computers etc.
FERC Developments
 Secretary of Energy Richardson issued an emergency order requiring
EPMI to market energy to  the ISO.  In addition, another emergency order was
issued today.  I enclose the order and the press release. The Press release
for today's order is included below. The FERC special meeting on California
was videotaped by Nancy Pickover of Bracewell and is being sent to us.
  <<202corder.pdf>>  <<Califnotice.pdf>>  <<dec15caorder.pdf>>
Dan Watkiss Analysis of FERC Order re Penalties for Refusal to sell Energy
 Last Friday, the ISO filed with FERC Amendment No. 33 to its tariff.
Among other things, the Amendment adds to the section 5 of the  tariff  new
provisions empowering the ISO to assess a penalty against Participating
Generators that refuse to operate in response to an ISO Dispatch instruction
during a System Emergency or when the ISO is acting to avoid an imminent or
threatened System Emergency.   The penalty is stiff:  (1) a charge for each
MWh of the Dispatch instruction with which the Participating Generator does
not comply equal to twice the highest price for Energy, per MWh, paid in
each hour by the ISO to any other entity to produce Energy; and (2) if the
ISO is required t call for the involuntary curtailment of firm Load to
maintain Applicable Reliability Criteria during the System Emergency, then
an additional charge equal to $1,000 for each MWh of the Dispatch
instruction with which the Participating Generator does not comply.  The
only defense to these penalties is to provide proof that the generating unit
in question was physically incapable of running or it would have violated
state or federal law to run it (e.g., air emission allowance limits).  The
ISO asked FERC for an immediate effective date of December 8, which FERC
granted in a December 8 order.

 The ISO Tariff defines ""Participating Seller or Generator"" to mean
""A generator or other seller of Energy or Ancillary Services through a
Scheduling Coordinator over the ISO Controlled Grid and which has undertaken
to be bound by the terms of the ISO Tariff.""  If Enron is a Participating
Generator (Mary Hain informs me that Enron is not one), then it risks
incurring the new penalty if it fails to respond to an ISO order to sell
ancillary services to  the ISO.  I believe Enron might also risk incurring
the penalty in cases where it controls or has rights to all or a portion of
a generating capacity of a Participating Generator's unit.  If that capacity
is called on and the call is not answered because Enron is making some other
use of the capacity, the Enron may incur the penalty .  This seems to be
contemplated by section 4.1.1 of the Participating Generator Agreement which
obliges a Participating Generator to comply with the tariff (section 5.3) by
identifying the Generating Units that it owns, operates or has a contractual
entitlement to in Schedule 1, as required by Section 5.3 of the ISO Tariff.
(emphasis added).   As far as I know, it is that Schedule 1 that the ISO
consults when making decisions as to which Participating Generator to call
on.

Thanks
Gary

	Steve,

	Per your advice, I have removed the ""excessive heat"" allegation in the petition.  How does it look to you now?

	Please let me know at your earliest convenience.  You confirmed that while we know for sure that the contamination didn't occur prior to October 28, and that it was discovered on or about November 4, we don't know for an absolute certainty that it didn't occur, say, on October 29, 1999.  Accordingly, if Baytank won't grant us an extension of time to file suit against it (and you, Richard and Jim were bcc'd on the e-mail I just sent to the president of some Baytank entity asking for such an extension), then I want to be ready to file this suit on Friday.

	A related point:  I have included the name of the Baytank entity with whom Philchem executed the Marketing Agreement, which is the only Baytank corporate entity that I know of that had some responsibility for the contamination.  However, the Marketing Agreement does not say whether that Baytank entity owns, leases or operates the facilities in question.  It would be preferable to name any and all Baytank entites that own, lease or operate the facility in question.  Short of calling Baytank and asking, do you know how we could find this out very quickly?

	Many thanks.

	Britt

	P.S.:  Richard,  should I go ahead and send out a GC memo on this suit, in case Baytank doesn't promptly respond to my request for an extension of time?  ",deleted items,10,2001,23

point.  Too many to make that practical these days.  When I started the 
confirm desk in 1994, traders were signing confirms at that time. Once they 
knew that they had someone who would take responsibility to make sure they 
were right, they were very glad to pass that responsibility to me.  In the 
early days of power, the traders once again were signing confirms.  Obviously 
interested in the details of every deal that was done.  But as the business

Quick question - your confirms - are they signed by both Commercial & Comm 
Supp (as Attorney at Fact) - or by just one or the other?

I want to make sure EBS is consistent.

Currently - one of either Jim F or Paul R are signing all of them - rightly 
so at the moement - not many deals and they want to see all.

Thoughts?

	  ETS Intranet Consolidation Project Updates (www.ETS.enron.com)	

What is the status of the consolidation?

Completed Sites:
The core ETS Intranet Site, www.ets.enron.com
ETS Solution Center http://www.ets.enron.com/Services/Solution_Center/default.htm
Self-Directed Task Force http://www.ets.enron.com/Services/SDWT/default.htm

Sites in Progress:
Safety Site http://www.ots.enron.com/safety/default.htm
Design and Records Management
Engineering Standards http://www.ots.enron.com/docs/stds/0000-1.htm 

How will this consolidation affect me as a user? As we roll out new sites, any bookmarks to the old sites will need to 
be modified.  If you navigate to an old site, you will see a redirect message requesting that you update your bookmarks and a link to the new site.

What are the next steps?
The Intranet team will be contacting Webmasters with content or applications on the current ETS website (www.ots.enron.com)
to discuss the migration.  All content and applications on this web server will be moved to the new ETS Intranet before the end of the 2nd quarter.

Subject: update on offsite

I am happy to report that, because so many people wanted to bring a ""first 
lieutenant"", Rick and Cindy have agreed to put the primary focus of the Aug 
29-31 offsite on financials and procurement, with enough HR representation to 
cover some of the broad strategic issues that cross multiple functional 
areas.  

Consequently, Elise and Mike will be able to attend.  More information on 
logistics to follow within two weeks.  We will block off hotel rooms, etc. in 
the meantime.  

As with the last ASE, it's an ""all or nothing"" proposition.  Because of the 
structure of the event, participants must be there from start to finish (no 
partial attendance).  We are still trying to get it to 2 days, but worst case 
we will set it so that people can fly up Tuesday morning and fly back 
Thursday night.

I am looking forward to everyone's participation and input.Thanks!

My name is Jeff Jackson, I grew up with the Whammer!!!!!

I would appreciate if you guys could let me know ASAP if you can attend his
bachelor party on Saturday Feb. 3. We need to get a head count so we can
determine costs and accomodations if necessary.

Location: Houston

We will start out with some mudbugs and beer....

The plan is to charter a party bus to take care of us that
evening.....wherever we might end up.

If anyone is interested in hotel accomidations please indicate in your
email, we will incoprorate that into our plans. Any ideas, for something to
do between mudbugs and late night carousing....bring 'em on  (ie.....horse
races, go carts........etc.

Also, as an alternative to staying in Houston, Gary and i thought about
taking a bus  and spending Saturday and Saturady night in Lake Charles,
gambling and........

Again..Please As soon as possible send a reply if you are going and any
suggestions will help.

I will be in Houston next week and was wondering if you could spare me some 
time to talk about the back office for Australia. I am the CFO in Sydney and 
am currently running the settlements work done down here and I would also 
like to go over the results of the audit. 

At the moment I have time available both on Wed and Thursday and would 
appreciate it if we could meet up on either of those days if you are 
available. (AC Romero in Cassandra Schultz's office is co-ordinating my

2001-03-15 05:54:00+00:00,frozenset({'russell.long@enron.com'}),frozenset({'brian.redmond@enron.com'}),kitchen-l,"I finished the walk through of the 15th floor space located at 1201 Louisiana this afternoon.  On the walk through with me were Paul Foust (facilities), Robert Humlicek, Jeffrey Vincent and Andrew Hawthorn.  I previously talked with Deborah Bubenko and Vincent Fox about this space.  Comments from the review are as follows:

Most of the floor is composed of offices with some large group areas (conference rooms etc.) included.  The floor can accommodate up to 150 people.  However, with this amount of people in the area, space will be VERY tight. Almost all offices will need to hold at least two people.  Large offices will need to hold three or four.  The larger areas will need to have cubicles installed to make complete use of the space.  With maximum doubling up in the offices, you might fit a couple of conference rooms on the floor with one kitchen area.  There are nooks just off some of the hallways that would accommodate several network printers.

As Tommy stated in his earlier e-mail on the Allen center space, the fire code will require us to put a strobe in each office with multiple occupants. 

One area of concern is the amount of furniture currently on the floor.  The floor plan shows approximately 90 desks on the floor.  Some offices were locked so we could not verify the total.  However,  this number appears correct.  Also, for the most part, there were only desks in the offices unless they were occupied.  Chairs, filing cabinets, credenzas, etc. would needed to be added to this space.  We need to determine where the additional furniture will come from. 

There is one large area with 11 cubicles forming a circle.  According to Paul, this was the area where telephones were answered for the previous tenant.  This might work for the trading area.  The room appears to have the most telephone connectivity, is open, and would accommodate up to 11.

If we decide trader telephones are necessary (record conversations etc.), the cost associated with the purchase of the equipment and the necessary installation time will need to be factored into our schedule.  

The floor has two data closets.  At least one of the closets has 24 hour air conditioning according to Vincent.  

This floor has the same server connectivity at the Three Allen Center space.  A 100 meg single mode fiber connection serves this space. 

Robert has informed me that the floor currently has switches to support up to 200 ports.  However, this does not mean that the drops to all offices are complete.  Probably some cabling will need to be added.  It appears that the space can accommodate up to 150 users even with the extra ports needed for network printers, laptops, etc.  However, if we need to accommodate more than 200 ports, additional switches can be added. 

In summary, the floor space at 1201 Louisiana looks as good or better than the space that was being considered at Three Allen Center.

Sally,

FYI.  This is an example of the issues associated with the risk feeds and the need to document the universe of books that should be sent to RisktRAC on a daily basis.  Both Todd and Shona are working to reconcile RisktRAC positions to the source liquids books, identify the omitted books and make corrections.  The total volume difference is 3.4 million barrels (not certain this is accurate, but material under any circumstance).  I am also not certain how long these positions have not been included.  I believe this issue it limited to VAR only, and that CreditAg has been reporting the credit exposures. 

It would be a good idea to dissect this particular problem to understand the scope of what we need for Project Green Light.  If you would like to discuss this further, let me know.  I would like to ask for the following,  1) how long have these books not been included in RisktRAC,   2) what is the impact on V@R,   3) total volumes not reported,  and 4) reason for omission (I believe it had to do with the portfolio hierarchy).  Please, let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Wanda

2001-03-27 18:10:00+00:00,frozenset({'sally.beck@enron.com'}),frozenset({'greg.piper@enron.com'}),beck-s,"In a recent CommodityLogic staff meeting, I took stock of the number of 
people and projects that I have provided from Energy Operations to that 
team.  From conversations that you and I have had, I get the impression that 
perhaps others have led you to believe that my commitment to CommodityLogic 
has been limited.  The truth is that I hand picked key members of the team 
and transferred projects that we were already undertaking in Energy 
Operations to round out the suite of products to be offered through 
CommodityLogic.  I just thought that it might be helpful for you to have the 
facts so that you are fully informed whenever you are involved in 
conversations around CommodityLogic. 

Staffing Contributions
 CommodityLogic Project Manager (NomLogic):  Carrie Slagle, Manager
 CommodityLogic Project Maanger (Integration):  Susan Harrison, Manager
 CommodityLogic Project Manager (ContactLogic)  Mary Solmonson, Senior 
Director
 CommodityLogic Team Member (NomLogic):  Molly Sumrow, Specialist

 User Requirement and Testing Staff:  Energy Operations Gas Schedulers, Power 
Confirmation Team and   Financial Settlements 

Projects Transferred to CommodityLogic

 NomLogic (previously known as Contract Exchange in Energy Operations)
 ContactLogic (global databases in Energy Operations) 


Two of the Project Managers on the team, Carrie Slagle and Susan Harrison, 
were transferred from Energy Operations to CommodityLogic.  Both had worked 
in managerial roles in our natural gas business, reporting to Brent Price.  
Both had been significantly challenged in the first half of 2000 by roles 
where they were charged with managing large teams of people.  But knowing 
both Carrie and Susan well, I viewed them as valuable members of the 
operations team who know a lot about the business.  Both have proven in the 
past to be good project leaders. Therefore, identifying them as project 
managers for CommodityLogic made a lot of sense -- providing gas operations 
experience to the CommodityLogic effort and utilizing their skills most 
appropriately .  Brent Price and I worked together to sell Susan and Carrie 
on the assignment and to transition them to their CommodityLogic roles very 
quickly.  

One of the key team members working under Carrie Slagle on NomLogic was a 
scheduler on our gas team (Molly).  Bob Hall, our opeartions controller over 
natural gas, suggested that a scheduler on the team would be valuable, since 
Carrie and Susan have actually never scheduled gas themselves.  NomLogic was 
already a project that was underway in Energy Operations.  We started the 
project shortly after the tremendous ramp up in natural gas volumes due to 
EOL transactions.  We called the project Contract Exchange, and Bob Superty, 
who is the daily manager over gas logistics, was the project sponsor.  Tom 
looped in our Contract Exchange project into CommodityLogic and subsequently 
renamed it NomLogic.  Molly had been a member of the Contract Exchange 
project team, and we transfered her along with the project to 
CommodityLogic.  

Many of my key employees in gas scheduling, confirmations and settlements 
work very closely with the various CommodityLogic project managers.  It is 
input from my group that has created the modules by defining user 
requirements and they have served as the testing teams as well.   

In the fall, I assigned Mary Solmonson to focus full time on CommodityLogic.  
I recognized that we needed more senior level involvement and I viewed Mary's 
participation as a good way to leverage my time.  Previously, she was a 
senior director managing our Global Databases group.  With an IT development 
background and a very thorough knowledge of our operations business, Mary was 
the perfect candidate out of my direct report team to focus on 
CommodityLogic.  Unfortunately, her recent health problems will curtail her 
involvement going forward.  During the five months that she was assigned to 
CommodityLogic, Mary developed a plan for ContactLogic that Tom feels is 
excellent and notes that it is an important complement to the other modules.  

Early in the project, I had also selected two very key and knowledgeable 
operations professionals to be part of the  CommodityLogic team - Leslie 
Reeves, who played a significant role in building Enron's power business from 
day one, and Todd Hall, with experience in natural gas and emerging 
products.  They were part of the  CommodityLogic team in the early days, and 
both made personal decisions to exit the team and return to managing mid and 
back office operations.   Susan Harrison and Carrie Slagle were their 
replacements on CommodityLogic.

there are some ski resorts there--something like that would also offer our

We have had discussions about Barry in the past and I have followed-up on 
specific instances you have mentioned - I believe they date back to 1998 and 
prior to my first hand experience of working with Barry throughout 1999, and 
the people who raised concerns then acknowledge that the environment has 
changed since then. We are not so Barry-dependent. We have a team of quality 
risk management professionals as evidenced by the fact that it is the primary 
recruiting ground for the RAC team (David Port, Oliver Gaylard). 

Barry's role is much less hands-on now and he is not our candidate for the 
Global Products position - this will continue to be Kevin Sweeney. The role I 
suggest for Barry is the high level co-ordination of the operations team - 
his energy, enthusiasm and ability to execute on a plan, combined with his 
considerable institutional knowledge, making a superior candidate difficult 
to find. Frankly, I suggested Steve Young not for additional depth, but to 
address the relationship issue that clearly exists - I do not belittle this 
issue, and while I don't think that anyone can point to any ""prosecutable"" 
offences that Barry may have committed in recent history, his management 
style doesn't help to promote the view that he is totally impartial and 
objective. I will say that he has always been open and frank (very frank) 
with me - indeed if Mally and Sweeney had been as open we may have had a 
different story to tell on Helsinki.

As an aside, I have not been involved in or consulted on the 'World Tour', 
although I know that Barry suggested this sort of thing to Sally a few weeks 
back. I think it is great that Brent Price is involved, but we would be happy 
to contribute staff to this too.

Subject: Re: Trading Support Operations - London  

Fernley,
As we discussed earlier this year, I have serious concerns about Barry that I 
think are both well-founded and reasonably well documented.  To be fair, I 
will say that since Q1 of last year, I have not seen any FURTHER 
""prosecutable"" offenses and he has made some attempts at being more 
communicative.  However, I am clearly unwilling to stake my career on his 
transformation, particulary with as influential person as John Sherriff in 
charge of the office.  Probably more to the point,
it continues to concern me that London has not developed an operations team 
that is not so Barry-dependent.  Evidence to this effect are, the fact that 
he is your only candidate for the Global Products position, that someone from 
Houston has to be part of the ""World Tour""  in Europe (Brent Price), that 
your candidates  for a senior interim operations head in Helsinki was David 
Port or Richard Sage, and that your suggestion for additional depth is Steve 
Young.

Further for the record, I believe that I am not the only one with whom Barry 
has a credibility issue - Arthur Andersen, other Global Products personnell, 
and other risk people in London have expressed similar concerns to me - I 
just happen to be the most vocal.

Subject: Trading Support Operations - London

Rick,

Not wishing to delay the comprehensive review of our trading support 
function, particularly as it relates to our Global Products business, we 
already have Barry Pearce taking a lead in this area.

The issue of concern is whether this should be an interim measure or a more 
permanent solution.  Well - nothing is permanent in Enron and I think Barry 
understands this as well as anybody. If we had a more suitable candidate, we 
would give him/her the job. 

I have seen Barry develop and mature over the last 12 months along with the 
team that we have built around him. I'm convinced that he can add significant 
value by drawing the Global Products support functions 'in to the fold'. 
However, he clearly has a credibility issue with Ted in particular and, 
whilst I do not share Ted's views, I do not hold Barry out as a saint and I 
can see recurring problems if such a key relationship is not well grounded.

I suggest that we continue to search for a candidate - known and trusted 
within Houston, who can instill confidence there. Steve Young (head of RAC in 
London) may be an interesting option, although I'm sure he would not be easy 
to replace. In the meantime we need Barry to take things forward and I will 
be monitoring the situation very closely.

Regards

Subject:	Broker Client

Louise--

In response to some considerable concern voiced by Presto, we are re-evaluating our Broker Client relationships.  I'm planning to send the following email to each of the desk heads.  It is intended primarily to generate feedback from the desks, but my ultimate plan is to shut down the relationships and essentially start over with the desks making the transaction decisions instead of EOL.  Before I launched it, I wanted to get your thoughts.

Thanks,
Brad



Earlier this year, Enron executed deals with certain Broker's which allows the broker to execute transactions for their clients via a Broker Client which is linked to the EnronOnline platform.  All executions done on Broker Client are free of brokerage charges.  To date, about 80% of the 3,400 broker trades executed on-line have been in the US Power segment.  The companies that have access to read and execute transactions using the Broker Client are as follows:

APB Energy, Inc. (Canadian Nat Gas, Canadian Power, US Nat Gas, US Power, US Coal, US Emissions, US Weather, US Crude, US Bandwidth)
Natsource LLC (US Nat Gas, US Power, Canadian Nat Gas, US Coal, US Emissions)
Amerex Natural Gas I, Ltd. (Asian Crude, Bandwidth, US Crude, US Nat Gas, Belgian Nat Gas, Canadian Nat Gas, European Crude)
Amerex Power, Ltd. (Australian Power, Austrian Power, Bandwidth, Canadian Power, Dutch Power, German Power, Nordic Power, Spanish Power, Swiss Power, UK Power, US Power)
Power Merchants Group, LLC (US Financial Nat Gas)
Prebon Energy, Inc. (US Nat Gas, Canadian Nat Gas, US Power, Canadian Power, US Coal, US Emissions, US Crude)
Prebon Marshall Yamane (UK) Ltd (UK Gas, UK Power, Continental Power, Continental Gas, European Crude, European Weather, Asian Weather, Asian Crude, European Bandwidth)
Natsource Tullett Europe Limited (UK Nat Gas, UK Power, Continental Gas, Continental Power, European Coal)
GFI EnergyNet LLC (US Nat Gas, US Power, Canadian Gas, Canadian Power)
TFS Energy, LLC (US Nat Gas, US Power, Canadian Nat Gas, Canadian Power, US Bandwidth)

A significant concern has been raised that these relationships have amounted to a free option on the part of the brokers, who will transact with Enron on long-dated product only if they can't find an equal or better price from a supplier who will pay brokerage.  While I am confident that this possibility was discussed when the deals were struck, the current situation calls for some changes.  Accordingly, our plan would be to exercise our right to shut down all Broker Clients immediately.  As a result, we would be forced to return approximately $1.2 MM in fees paid by the brokers listed above.

Let me be clear that this does not preclude future Broker Client arrangements.  The decision to engage in future deals should be made on a commodity-by-commodity and region-by-region basis.  In other words, we can grant access to whichever product types the desks feel comfortable with.  If particular desks have broker relationships that they would like to move on-line in support of their market, the technology and resources are available to make this happen.  What we are currently seeking is simply a reset on the Broker Client product so that we are not employing a ""one-size-fits-all"" solution.

I would welcome your thoughts and comments on this course of action before we decide to proceed.

Thanks,
Brad Richter",eol,8,2001,30

Adding Enron's ""negative CTC claim"" to the list of claims: PGE's filing included a list of top twenty creditors.  Our negative CTC claim was apparently not taken into account in compiling that list.  The list is nonbinding, however.  PG&E will be required to file schedules of creditors on April 20.  Our negative CTC claim should be on Schedule F (for unsecured claims).  You may want to remind Glynn of your previous conversations and state our expectation that the negative CTC claim will appear (preferably as uncontested) in the April 20 filing. (Note: if PG&E does not include the claim we have an opportunity to file a proof of claim and ultimately the court determines the validity of the claim).
Including Enron on the Creditors' Committee:  PG&E may have the opportunity to influence representation on the creditors' committees.  There are several reasons to suggest to Glynn that we be included: 1) we are a big creditor, 2) we could be helpful in crafting a broader solution, and 3) we are one of the real parties in interest behind the PX and ISO (who were listed as significant creditors but are really just ""passthroughs"" for the suppliers ... and PG&E likely would not want to have those political bodies serving on the creditors committee anyway).",portland,4,2001,10

focus should occur, what projects should potentially be slowed or halted, 
what projects can be leveraged across multiple business units, and what new 
initiatives / technology should be initiated and explored.  In addition to 
Sally's direct reports, Joel also plans to make contact with other business 
units as well including Richard Sage in London.

Subject: Strategic Systems Plan

Greetings Sally!  During the next week and a half, we will begin the process 
of collecting information which will be used to write the Strategic Systems 
Plan.  Basically, the Strategic Systems Plan will be used to identify several 
areas of opportunity within each business unit such as:

Each business units overview and the role technology plays in their area
Current trends in each business area
Using technology to help you achieve corporate goals/objectives
Current departmental/business unit goals
Using technology help you achieve departmental goals/objectives
Projected business growth in twelve (12) to eighteen (18) months?
Current technology being used
Mission critical applications
IT resources which are available
Business Continuity Plans (BCPs) 
Do you have any technology projects underway?
Current projects
Top 3 priorities
How are IT projects and/or computer requests tracked 
Desired/Future Projects
Issues/Concerns

The following process will be used to accomplish this:

A cover letter with a questionnaire explaining what we wish to accomplish and 
the process will be emailed to each of your direct reports
An interview will be set up with each direct report.  Each meeting will be 
scheduled for approximately 45 minutes.
Results of the questionnaire and interview will be used to create a draft 
report
The draft report will be distributed for comments
A final report with recommendations will be written and distributed.

I hope this process meets with your approval.  I can be reached at 58841.

Thank You!

Subject:	Conversation with Edison re: Getting Negative CTC Paid

I talked to John Fielder (SVP Edison) about setting up a meeting for Barry Tycholiz with Edison's CFO about hedging Edison's QF price risk. Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said:

They plan to ""settle"" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02.
Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP.
He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways:  1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down).  The numbers are illustrative only.
In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.)
I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed.
He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison ""meet and confer"" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.
Fielder is also the point person on ""getting ESPs paid"" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next.
It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.

If you have any questions, let us know.

Subject: Interconnect / Intercompany issues

Below is a list of the major items that are still outstanding on the 
interdesk/interconnect report for 1999 and 2000 that is impacting the 
intercompany cleanup for SAP implementation.  These issues have been 
addressed in earlier E-Mails and this is an updated list of issues that need 
to be completed by June 19, 2000.


1) King Ranch interstates - Fred and Stella are working with Exxon to 
reconcile from Oct 1999 - Apr 2000 the interstate nominations for Tennessee 
and NGPL and also for Tejas.
                             
2) Tetco Meter 6892 -  Question of who has custody transfer at the meter.  
ENA is using Tetco's  volume and HPLC is using the HPL Measurement volume, 
causing a desk to desk variance.
                                            Clem and Pat are working on.

3) Transco Bammel  Meter 74 - Transco and HPL's nominations are out of 
balance at Meter 74. Charlotte needs to work with Transco to resolve.

4) Dow  Meter 4486 - The sale to Entex needs to be taken off of HPLC meter 
4486 and the sale needs to be at Dow Meter 4486.  
                                          A desk to desk between ENA (buyer) 
and HPLC (seller) needs to be set up on Dow Meter 4486.
                                          Ami needs to set up the deals and 
Thu needs to coordinate the months involved.

                                          Once this is done and Thu 
reallocates to Dow Pipeline, Jackie needs to zero out the confirmed noms and 
make the meter non allocatable in Pops.
                                          Clem verified with Steve Schneider 
that this meter is not on HPL's system.

5) East Texas Gas / Devon     - Devon invoicing ENA entire flow at Carthage.
     Meter 4607701                           East Texas keeping HPLC whole on 
nominations
                                                             Desk to desk 
deal is out of balance because of this 
                                                             Karen is working 
with Pennzoil and East Texas to reach agreement on how to handle this issue 
between them
          

6) PGEV -  Actuals on swing meters (HPL ) not matching expense volumes being 
allocated by PGEV.  
                    Sherlyn is working with Stacey and Charlotte to resolve.

7) Pan Energy Sales issues - discrepancies on PGEV.  Katherine and Sherlyn 
are working with Stacey  to resolve.

If I understand correctly our posting period for this capacity expires on Monday at 5 p.m.
You should accumulate service requests for the capacity until that time.  Tie bids will be decided by a lottery.
If shippers ask you can explain to them that since this is newly posted capacity, we're posting it until 5 p.m. Monday and will not award capacity until that time, and if requests for service exceed available capacity we'll award it based on the procedures in Section 13 of the FTS-1 Rate Schedule.

Subject:	RE: TW posting question -- URGENT

Per our previous decisions, we have utilized the provisions of section 13 for purposes of allocating capacity.  Therefore I agree with Maria, that we would need to conduct a lottery if there are tie bids. I also agree that the reference to fCFS in Section 1 is meaningless and should be eliminated.  I would guess that that was there from inception, and has just been a non event.   Mary, put on clean up log.   MK

It does say first come first served, but then in the ROFR section says we won't maintain a queue.
Maybe we should delete ""first come, first served"" next time we do a tariff cleanup filing?

Subject:	RE: TW posting question -- URGENT

I'm assuming that we did not post any parameters or allocation methodology on March 19.   Without any parameters, we're better off sticking as close to the tariff allocation mechanism as possible.  The reason we post for 5 days is to have a pseudo-open season, giving everyone a shot at this capacity and treating all shippers during the open season similarly no matter when they came in.  Allocating the capacity on a FCFS basis is contrary to the open season concept.   I think we would be better off to treat both shippers similarly by allocating their equal bids pursuant to the lottery mechanism which is set forth in our tariff.  That's my vote.   thanks, maria

Subject:	TW posting question -- URGENT
Importance:	High

Conoco did not exercise its right of first refusal on 20,000 of capacity on TW so it has gone back out on our EBB yesterday.
Mindful of our posting guidelines for newly available capacity (i.e. 5 days before we sell for a year or more, 3 days before we sell it for a term of 5 months - 1year, 1 day if we are going to sell it for 5 months or less), assume the following scenario:

March 19:  capacity is posted
March 21:  Shipper A calls one of our marketers and offers max rate for the capacity for 2 years
March 22:  Shipper B calls and offers max rate for the capacity for 2 years
March 23:  posting period ends (assuming of course that the capacity got posted at 9 a.m. on March 19)

Questions:  Who gets the capacity?  What do we tell Shippers A and B?

We could say ""first come first served,"" but our tariff specifically states that we will not maintain a queue.
Is the better answer that we accumulate service requests until the close of the posting period, then have a lottery?

Please let me know your comments.  We need a consensus ASAP -- before we get that first offer.  Thanks.

We received a little inside information on Cinergy (no guarantee if reflective of corporate view, but insightful non the less).  The feedback indicates that holding firm in our ""no run"" stance is the best position to take at this time.

Apparently this ""run/no run"" issue is partly an internal political issue between Houston and Cincinnati, whereby the operators in Cincinnati think Tang and Vivar cut a bum deal on this remedial work issue which allowed these modifications (bearing and silencer at Brownsville, control curves at Caledonia) but did not require any testing.  It appears the guys in Cincinnati are posturing such that if the machines break or don't work as planned, the blame would then fall on Tang and Vivar (this helps explain why Tang is so adamant about running).  The view was that given this, ultimately the PSA rules and running is not required.   

Let me know if you need any more color.

Thanks for your help.

Subject:	Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy


Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.

services; however, they will be selling test gas in 
ramp up period.  Right now, these first deliveries are going into the ANR 
system because it is the only interconnect that is 
ready.

Alliance Delayed, But Deliveries Begin Ramping Up

After months of speculation in the industry, Alliance Pipeline confirmed 
yesterday full commercial service will be delayed nearly a month until Oct. 
30. When construction of the system was scheduled nearly three years ago, 
Oct. 2 was the target date for commercial service. 

However, the delay doesn't mean the market won't be getting any Canadian gas 
out of Alliance until the end of October. The pipeline opened one of its 
Chicago delivery valves last Thursday and started selling 50-100 MMcf/d of 
gas into the market. It intends to increase its sales each week eventually 
reaching its full 1.325 Bcf/d load prior to switching to commercial service 
on Oct. 30, said spokesman Jack Crawford. 

""We got Commission approval to actually sell our test gas. Right now I think 
we are dealing with three or four different marketers. Our initial deliveries 
right now are into the ANR system. That's because its basically the only 
connection that is ready, but over the next few weeks we expect they will all 
be ready to go and we will test them all. 

""I'd be surprised if it ends up being regular [volume increases of 100 MMcf/d 
each week] but that's kind of the game plan,"" said Crawford. ""On Oct. 29 it 
will be Alliance selling [1.325 Bcf/d of] test gas, and on Oct. 30 it will be 
shippers nominating at one end and delivering at the other. The market may 
not see much of a difference. We obviously don't want to start charging our 
shippers until we have the confidence that all the systems have been checked 
out."" 

The pipeline system is designed to deliver gas from producing regions of 
northeastern British Columbia and northwestern Alberta to the Chicago area 
where the line interconnects with the North American pipeline grid. 
Currently, more than 99% of the total pipeline system has been installed, 
including 14 mainline compressor stations, 37 receipt points in British 
Columbia and Alberta, and 7 delivery points in Illinois. Commissioning 
activities commenced in March, including the flowing of gas into the 
completed sections of line to purge air from the pipe. At present, 
approximately 95% of Alliance has been purged of air. This includes all the 
mainline portion of the system (1,857 miles) from near Gordondale, Alberta to 
the delivery section near Joliet, Illinois and 306 of 434 mile laterals 
receipt portion of the system. Additionally, 25 receipt point meter stations 
have been commissioned. Final commissioning activities are also being 
completed at 14 mainline compressor stations. To date, 6 Bcf of gas is in the 
commissioned mainline and lateral portions of the system, with the ultimate 
line pack targeted at 8 Bcf. 

Crawford said there were a variety of factors that contributed to the delayed 
start-up. ""The rain in Saskatchewan delayed us a bit back in July, but we 
managed to catch up on the construction there in August. But it then meant 
that some of our commissioning didn't get going until a little bit later. 
Farther west in Alberta and BC in fact we've had a couple of rain problems. 
In particular, we have one relatively small but fairly long lateral that we 
haven't even been able to get on the right of way yet and that's because of 
rain. 

""Up in BC we've been having trouble with a directional drill of a creek on 
one of our laterals up there,"" he said. ""We're likely to get approval to 
open-cut that creek, but that will take us probably the better part of a 
month. 

""On the downstream end, we had hoped to get more of our downstream 
connections right now. We are testing one, but some of the others aren't 
quite ready yet. We're ready, but they are not. Then of course there is a 
fairly complex interaction between the pipeline and the [Aux Sable liquids] 
plant. We haven't had a chance to work on that yet. So when you look at all 
of those things, the question was when could we establish a date when all 
this stuff would be done and we would be operational. We spent a fair amount 
of time with our shippers and they mentioned one other pipeline that was 
being delayed one day at a time drove them to distraction. We agreed we would 
pick one of three dates, all Mondays: Oct. 2, Oct. 16 or Oct. 30, and we just 
had to pick one that we felt confident in."" 

Besides the timing of service, there has been another important question on 
the minds of many market observers. Will the gas Alliance ships come Oct. 30 
be incremental gas or gas that would have been flowing through TransCanada. 

""I don't think it's going to be purely either way,"" said Crawford. ""Lots of 
guys are targeting for Nov. 1 to bring their new gas on to start the gas year 
so it all depends on how much shows up. It's not a big secret that we've had 
some wet weather and some of the drilling and completion work hasn't gotten 
done. That's likely to have some affect on it as well. That's a delay though. 
How long are people going to pay $6 for gas? Boy, people are going to have a 
lot of money for drilling and projects.""

El Paso Natural Gas has received approval from the U.S. Department of 
Transportation's Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) to conduct more internal 
inspections on its rebuilt New Mexico pipeline, which ruptured August 19 
killing 11 people (see Daily GPI, Aug. 22). Since the explosion, flows 
through the line, which runs from West Texas to California, have been reduced 
to 85% capacity, or about 920 MMcf/d. 

OPS said the El Paso line has already been repaired and put through 
hydrostatic testing, which it passed. Hydrostatic testing checks for cracks 
by forcing high-pressure water through the line. Now El Paso has the green 
light to begin smart pig testing, which will examine the internal integrity 
of the line. The device, called a pig because of the sound it makes during 
inspections, has sensors and once placed inside the line, it can detect 
dents, deformities and changes in wall thickness. 

Neither OPS nor El Paso released a timetable as to when the pigging would 
occur or how long it would take. However, once the testing is completed, the 
results will be evaluated by OPS, which then would determine if the line were 
safe for commercial use. 

OPS has not issued actual regulations on smart pig use, but they have become 
increasingly sophisticated and more widely used. Even though hydrostatic 
testing can actually detect certain flaws that are invisible to smart pigs, 
the pigging process is considered a complement to the water testing and 
ensures more integrity in test results. 

OPS requires all pipe to undergo at least one hydrostatic test after 
construction. Although not mandated, OPS also has proposed requiring 
pipelines that transport liquid petroleum products to use direct assessment 
methods such as pigging to evaluate the pipeline's integrity. Other types of 
inspections include using magnetic particles or ultrasound to measure the 
pipe wall's thickness.

Carly Fiorina Tops FORTUNE's List of 50 Most Powerful Women in Business for Fourth Year

10/01/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 1, 2001-- 

Lower-Profile Women Topple More Well-known Names From Tech and
Internet Sector; Ranking Includes 14 Newcomers 

Though Hewlett-Packard lost $65 billion in market value in a year, CEO Carly Fiorina hasn't lost her nerve, and for the fourth consecutive year holds the No. 1 position on FORTUNE's ranking of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business. 
The complete list and accompanying stories are in the October 15 issue of FORTUNE, available on newsstands October 8 and at www.fortune.com at 12:00 p.m. on October 1. 
In the No. 2 spot is eBay CEO Meg Whitman, who runs an Internet company that actually makes money: $85 million in the last four quarters on $582 million in revenue. Oprah Winfrey, the Queen of Media, is mightier than ever, and holds the No. 3 spot, up from No. 15 last year. She produces movies, brings comfort and advice to millions of TV viewers, propels books to bestsellerdom, and, last year, teamed up with Hearst Magazines' Cathie Black (No. 28 on the list) to publish O, The Oprah Magazine-by some measures the most successful magazine startup ever. At No. 4 is Andrea Jung, Chairman and CEO of Avon, who has breathed life into ailing Avon. Mirant CEO Marce Fuller-the only newcomer in the top five-holds the No. 5 position. Inside a stodgy utility, Southern, Fuller built a high-growth trading and marketing unit, which was spun off in April. 
In these new, more tempered times, patience may be about to reap its reward. In FORTUNE's annual survey of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business, there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly. Says FORTUNE senior writer Pattie Sellers in ""Patient But Not Passive,"" the story that accompanies the list, ""By patience, we mean staying with a company, steadily building influence there, and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge, not promises and self-promotion."" 
Fiorina, who has claimed the top spot each year since FORTUNE's inaugural list in 1998, heads the biggest company ($48 billion in revenues last year) run by a woman. And she is still as audacious and impatient as ever. Wall Street practically heckled her latest move-a bold bet to buy Compaq-but Fiorina, 47, remains defiant. In difficult times, ""people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny,"" she says. 
As always, the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time. Last year, power resided in the technology and Internet sectors, but that influence was fleeting. Gone from the list this year: Deborah ""Hurricane Debby"" Hopkins, who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at Lucent and lost her CFO job in May; Ellen Hancock, who failed at the startup, Exodus; and Morgan Stanley's Mary Meeker, who influenced so many to buy into the Internet fizz. But one Web warrior looks better than ever: Meg Whitman, No. 2 on the list. She has never overpromised to investors; instead she has diligently delivered above-target profits every single quarter. 
Fourteen newcomers join the list this year: Marce Fuller, President & CEO, Mirant; Louise Kitchen, COO, Enron Americas; Colleen Barrett, President & COO, Southwest Airlines; Betsy Bernard, President & CEO, AT&T Consumer; Anne Stevens, VP, North America Vehicle Operations, Ford Motor; Maria Elena Lagomasino, Chairman & CEO, J. P. Morgan Private Bank; Susan Desmond-Hellman, EVP and Chief Medical Officer, Genentech; Janet Robinson, SVP, Newspaper Operations, New York Times Co.; Carol Tomi, EVP and CFO, Home Depot; Carrie Cox, EVP and President, Global Prescriptions, Pharmacia; Carole Black, President and CEO, Lifetime Television Networks; Janet Davidson, Group President, Integrated Network Solutions, Lucent; Larree Renda, EVP, Retail Operations, Safeway; and Louise Francesconi, VP and GM, Missile Systems, Raytheon. 
While the economy and its points of power change, the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same. Says Sellers: ""We consider the size and importance of a woman's business in the global economy, her clout inside her company, and the arc of her career-where she has been and where she is likely to go. When appropriate, we also weigh the woman's influence on mass culture and society. That factor lifts Oprah Winfrey to No. 3 on this year's list."" The shifts on our list this year are dramatic, with 14 newcomers. But one trend is especially intriguing: Women are taking on bigger businesses than ever. A few years ago, responsibility for a $3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list. No more. This year's FORTUNE 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $20 billion or more, which is a first. 
In a related story, ""It Took a Lady To Save Avon,"" Katrina Brooker looks at Andrea Jung, Chairman and CEO of Avon. Says Brooker, ""Jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them. And that's what has made her one of the most successful CEOs-male or female-in recent years."" Over the past 20 months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way Avon does business: how it advertises, manufactures, packages, and even sells its products, and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated Avon Lady, but by reviving her. The result: growth in revenues, operating profits, and operating margins. 
In addition, FORTUNE includes an international list of the 50 powerful women in business. The top ten, featured in the magazine, are Marjorie Scardino, CEO, Pearson (Britain); Anne Lauvergeon, Chairman, Areva (France); Mary Ma, Senior VP & CFO, Legend (Hong Kong); Marianne Nivert, President & CEO, Telia (Sweden); Lien Siaou-Sze, Vice President, Hewlett-Packard (Hong Kong); Patricia Barbizet, CEO, Artemis (France); Eiko Kono, President, Recruit (Japan): Belinda Stronach, CEO, Magna International (Canada); Marina Berlusconi, Vice Chairman, Fininvest (Italy); Christine Tsung, President & CEO, China Airlines (Taiwan). You can read about the other forty at www.fortune.com or in the international editions of FORTUNE.

 I spoke with Bob Dorcheus, Brandywine about this issue and he suggest you 
and he get together and agree on a 
  price because the gas flowed into the plant.

 This gas flowed without a nomination.

The volumes on meter #1266 for 7/1/00 and 7/31/00 are valid gas flow.  7/1/00 
volumes are carry over from June activity (meter was shut in a little after 
9:00 AM on 7/1/00).   7/31/00 volumes were caused by the plant bringing on 
the meter before 9:00 AM on 8/1/00.

If you have any questions please call.  36449.

Subject:	FW: Impact and Influence

The past two years, Enron has offered a very effective two-day session called Executive Influence and Impact.  This is required of everyone at the VP level and above, and participation is definitely tracked.  I thought that the class was very helpful.  360 feedback is solicited prior to the session and is used in a very constructive and focused way to help each participant target two to three areas in which specific actions will be targeted to improve on the participant's leadership in communicating with and motivating employees.  

Enron will now offer this course tailored for Directors and Senior Directors.   I would like to have all directors and senior directors in our organization take advantage of this opportunity.  Unfortunately, I didn't find out about this opportunity early enough to work with everyone to plot out a schedule in advance for all directors and senior directors.  I want to work with the entire management team to create that plan, as sessions will be offered in May, September, November and February (2002).  

However, today is the deadline for registering participants for the first session, May 16 and 17.  This will be given in Houston.  I would like to have several participants from our team in this first session.  My suggestion would be that Brenda Herod and James Scribner attend as senior directors and that we also extend this opportunity to Shona Wilson and Thresa Allen as directors.  I have asked Hector to secure four spots for us, using these names as participants.  If this timing does not work, please let me know and we can determine who could be substituted for the May session.  We would have to name a sub right away, so please get back with me ASAP and confirm that the four names that I have suggested will be able to attend, or let me know your recommendation on a substitution.  
Thanks.

I have some flow at the above referenced meter without a deal.  Flow was for 
the first 2 days only, and probably occured as the meter was in the process

Sept.  Can you extend the deal, or should I allocated off to strangers?

Subject: King Ranch

I just spoke briefly with Brian Riley, who is working to restructure the Knig 
Ranch contracts with Exxon, and put Coastal into the loop.  Yesterday I 
forwarded each of you an E-mail from Steve Van Hooser which had drafts of 
contracts attached.  As I talked with Brian, the King Ranch set up as he is 
negotiating will be simplified.  The intent, as I understood it, is that we 
will no longer buy at the wellhead.  Rather, Coastal is entering into a a 
gathering agreement with HPL to buy at the wellhead and ship to the plant.  
HPLC will buy at the tailgate of the plant, net of PVR.  So there will not be 
future settlements with Exxon on liquids.  The paper has not been returned 
from Coastal or Exxon yet, but the deal is effective 4/1/00.  Everything will 
be under new agreements, with receipts and deliveries by different 
counterparties.  The gas flow continues the same, just under new contracts 
and different counterparties.

Daren, Pat and Stella:  Daren, Brian said he would get with you to discuss 
the deal in further detail.  Please include Pat and Stella in the discussion 
also.  The contracts should be reviewed and understood to ensure proper 
scheduling.  As I mentioned to Greg Sharp and Brian, it is critical that we 
be kept in the loop, especially on retroactive deals, as scheduling, 
transport rates and risk are affected.

Thanks to everyone for ensuring the communication lines are in place.

Max, we agree with you 100% that there are much stronger defenses to
McKenna's claims and appreciate the importance of not involving the
offtakers into this dispute.  However, we want to be prepared for what is
likely to be McKenna's ""strongest"" argument, especially if he digs up some

Charlotte,

There is an interconnect variance at meter 980071 for 2/99.   It appears the 
variance is created on 2/9/99 and 2/10/99.  There is a transport usage deal 
ticket 72893 in Sitara which shows PG&E delivers 6,965 mmbtu to HPL on 2/9/99 
and 3,683 mmbtu on 2/10/99, but HPL does not show a receipt of this volume.   
Let me know if you need the PG&E support.

USA: Enron shares in stay in doldrums after downgrade.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Enron Corp.'s share price hovered above seven-year lows touched in earlier trade Monday after Moody's Investor Service cut the credit status of its senior unsecured debt of North America's largest energy trader to two ratings above junk status. 
Enron, the largest electricity and natural gas trader in North America, also on Monday said it was in talks with banks to expand its credit lines to ease financial concerns that have sent its stock slumping more than 50 percent in the past two weeks.
Enron shares were down $1.40, or 9.03 percent, to $14.10 on the New York Stock Exchange, after earlier in the session trading below $14 for the first time since December 1994. 
Moody's also warned that it could cut the debt rating again, now downgraded to Baa2, as well as its rating for the Enron's commercial paper. 
Enron's credit-worthiness will have a direct affect on its day-to-day trading operations and its trading partners' perception of making good on trades. With a credit rating hovering above junk status, the cost of doing business will soar as trading partners look for increased collateral to back trades. 
Last week Enron shares lost almost $14 billion in market value as a series of piecemeal disclosures about the company's involvement in complex partnerships began to trickle out. 
Investors have fled Enron's stock in droves following disclosures that the company did off-the-balance sheet transactions with two limited partnerships run by former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow in deals the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is now looking into for possible conflict of interest. 
Enron compensated its partners in this off-balance sheet structure with the promise of Enron shares, if the value of private investments in several of its units fell below a certain level. 
Many industry observers see Enron's request for additional credit, after the company tapped its banks for $3.3 billion last week, as a sign a weakness. 
""We are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one's backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength, but instead ... it's an act of desperation,"" said Carol Levenson, an analyst with independent research firm gimmecredit.com.

USA: US companies' credit quality to worsen-Moody's.
By Jonathan Stempel

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - U.S. corporate credit quality is likely to grow much worse before it gets better, a leading credit rating agency said in a report issued on Monday. 
Moody's Investors Service said that in the third quarter, it put on review for downgrade its credit ratings for 122 U.S. companies. At the same time, it put on review for upgrade its ratings for just 22 companies.
That 5.5-to-1 ratio is far greater than the 1.3-to-1 ratio in the second quarter. 
In dollar terms, the situation looks more dire. Moody's warned it may downgrade $543 billion of debt, dwarfing the $66 billion Moody's said it may upgrade by 8.2-to-1. 
""Particularly in light of September 11, the fourth quarter will be particularly weak for credit rating changes,"" said John Puchalla, Moody's senior economist. ""A wide excess of rating reviews for downgrade over upgrades in the third quarter suggests credit deterioration will persist at least into early next year."" 
Rating reviews are significant because, unlike actual rating changes, they are not a ""lagging"" indicator, and suggest the future direction of corporate credit. Moody's normally wraps up its reviews within three months. 
U.S. corporate credit quality is falling for many reasons. These include the weakening U.S. economy, an inability of marginal companies to raise cash, debt-financed merger activity and fallout from the Sept. 11 attacks on such industries as airlines, insurance, and travel. 
For example, Moody's in July warned it may cut Comcast Corp.'s ratings after the Philadelphia-based company bid $44.5 billion for AT&T Corp.'s cable TV operations. 
Then last month, Moody's warned it may cut Chicago-based Boeing Co.'s ratings because of the attacks' potential impact on demand for commercial airplanes. 
In the third quarter, Moody's warned it may cut its ratings of 54 speculative-grade, or ""junk""-rated, companies, and raise the ratings of just 11. For investment-grade companies, the gap was even more yawning: 68-to-11. 
And in the fourth quarter? Through Friday, Moody's warned it may downgrade 47 companies and raise a mere four. On Monday, it downgraded embattled energy trading giant Enron Corp., and put all of its ratings on review for another downgrade. 
Puchalla, however, said the decline could slow next year, in part because interest rates are low and companies are managing their balance sheets more conservatively. 
""Lower borrowing costs and slowing debt growth should reduce debt servicing costs, and fiscal stimulus from the federal government should boost business revenues,"" he said. ""That is a positive for credit quality."" 
The third quarter was the 14th in a row when corporate rating downgrades outpaced upgrades. The record is 19 quarters, set between 1988 and 1993.

Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update1)

Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update1)

     (Updates with analyst comment in fifth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which can't get
low-interest, short-term loans, faces skeptical lenders who will
demand increasingly harsher terms as the largest energy trader
tries to get cash in the bank, credit analysts said.

     ``Anyone providing new funding is going to be nervous,'' said
Sean Egan, managing director at Egan-Jones Ratings Co. ``It's
likely that lenders are going to demand collateral.''

     Enron is trying to get $1 billion to $2 billion in loans from
Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other banks to calm
investors after a 52 percent drop in the company's stock since
Oct. 17, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company needs cash
every day to settle commodities transactions and to keep trading
partners.

     The company on Thursday tapped $3.3 billion in bank credit
lines last week to pay off about $2 billion in commercial paper,
or short-term corporate loans. A week ago, the Enron said the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission had began an inquiry into
related-party transactions. They cost the company $35 million and
$1.2 billion in lost shareholder equity.

     ``Banks are in the driver's seat, and Enron is a little
desperate,'' said Peter Petas, a debt analyst at CreditSights Inc.
``I think their interest rates for loans would go up.''

                       Sells Assets for Cash

     Companies in Enron's situation often agree to other bank
terms in order to secure loans, Petas said. Those can include
agreeing to use proceeds from selling assets to pay debt and
putting up assets as collateral.

     Enron is attempting to sell assets to raise cash. Two related
partnerships, Osprey and Marlin, depend on selling power plants
and similar assets to repay $3.3 billion borrowed to buy the
plants. Enron may have to pay any difference between the debt and
sales proceeds.

     The company plans to complete the $2.9 billion sale of
Portland General Electric, an Oregon utility, to Northwest Natural
Gas Co. next year.

     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell $1.30, or 8.4 percent, to
$14.10 in midday trading. Earlier, they touched $13.55, down 12
percent. The company's credit rating was cut by Moody's Investors
Service after it wrote down the value of its assets.

     The stock had tumbled 80 percent in the past 12 months.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Enron shares slipped to a new six-year low in early trade as North America's largest natural gas and electricity trader said it was talking to banks about tapping additional credit lines to ease financial concerns that have sent its stock slumping more than 50 percent in the past two weeks. 
Enron's shares were trading down 90 cents, or 5.8 percent, to $14.60 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares crashed through $15, a low not seen since February 1995.
Last week, Enron shed almost $14 billion in market value as its stock price tumbled more than half since last week, when a series of piecemeal disclosures about its involvement in complex partnerships began to trickle out. 
However, many industry observers see Enron's request for an additional credit after tapping its banks for $3.3 billion last week after as a sign a weakness not of strength. 
""We are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one's backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength, but instead ... it's an act of desperation,"" said Carole Levenson, research analyst with independent research firm gimmecredit.com.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp. said on Monday it is in talks with banks for additional credit, in a move to shore up investor confidence. 
Enron declined to comment on the size of the credit line, which banks it is in talks with and when it expects to complete an agreement on a new credit line.
""We want to restore investor and market confidence and nothing instills confidence like cash,"" said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. 
The Wall Street Journal reported Monday the beleaguered energy trader is negotiation with bank for a new credit line of between $1 billion to $2 billion to prop up share prices following last week's selling that sent shares plummeting. 
Enron said it drew about $3 billion in new credit lines last week, and has a net cash liquid position in excess of $1 billion. 
Enron shares sank 50 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $15 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. ((David Howard Sinkman, New York Newsdesk 646-223-6094)).

USA: UPDATE 1-Enron says in talks with banks for new credit line.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp. said on Monday it is in talks with banks for additional credit, in a new move to shore up investor confidence after it tapped about $3 billion in credit last week, and to stop a plunge in the company's stock that set new six-year lows. 
Enron declined to comment on the size of the credit line, which banks it is in talks with and when it expects to complete an agreement on the new credit line.
Enron shares crashed through a psychological barrier of $15 a share, shedding $1.66, or 10.65 percent, to $13.85 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has lost more than half of its value in the past two weeks, losing more than $14 billion in market capitalization. 
""We want to restore investor and market confidence and nothing instills confidence like cash,"" said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer in Houston. 
Enron shares have tumbled since the company reported its first-quarterly loss in more than four years on Oct. 16. The company also wrote down $1.2 billion in equity, including transactions with partnerships formerly run by its chief financial officer who was forced to step down from Enron last week. 
The sell-off was sparked by investor concern about the transparency of the transactions, which the Securities and Exchange Commission is examining. Enron last week replaced CFO Andrew Fastow as part of efforts to restore investor confidence. 
The Wall Street Journal reported Monday the beleaguered energy trader is negotiation with bank for a new credit line of between $1 billion to $2 billion to prop up share prices following last week's selling that sent shares plummeting. 
Enron said it drew about $3 billion in new credit lines last week, and has a net cash liquid position in excess of $1 billion. 
""Clearly, both the stock and bond market view Enron as being in dire straits,"" said independent research firm Gimme Credit analyst Carol Levenson.

POWER POINTS:Enron May Have To Rethink Asset-Light Focus
By Mark Golden

10/29/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- On the face of things, it's hard to understand the stock market's headspinning reaction to Enron Corp.'s (ENE) revelation of some bad news in recent weeks.
Why the talk of a ""death spiral"" for North America's premier energy trading company? The stock price of Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO), for example, saw an almost identical drop over a similar 12-month period. Nobody questioned the viability of Cisco. 
The difference is that over the past few years, Enron has redefined itself as a company that runs on financial and intellectual muscle - not hard assets - and that focus is getting the company into trouble now that its credibility is in question. 
If you're buying network components, you can probably stand some ambiguity in the finances of your supplier. After all, you're buying something you can touch. But if you're buying power or gas, what you're really buying is a commitment to deliver. If your supplier doesn't come through when the market gets tough, you're left totally exposed. In Enron's energy trading business, then, credibility at every level is critical. 
For now, Enron looks to be more than viable. But the company's asset-light strategy might not be. Gross profits from trading have shrunk to 1.65% in the third quarter from 5.26% in the first quarter of 1998. Meanwhile, asset-heavy energy companies like Mirant Corp. (MIR) and Calpine Corp. (CPN) successfully use trading to optimize the performance of power plants and other infrastructure. 
Two weeks ago, Enron reported a $618 million third-quarter loss, resulting from $1.01 billion in write-offs. That didn't send investors running, however. In fact, its stock price rose a bit on the news. 
What hurt was the disclosure that Enron had reduced its net assets, or ""shareholders' equity,"" by $1.2 billion as a consequence of unwinding positions in partnerships headed by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. That, along with warnings of possible downgrades by credit ratings agencies and an inquiry by the Securities & Exchange Commission produced a $15.6 billion drop in Enron's market value. 
On Monday, Moody's Investors Service followed through by downgrading its rating on Enron's senior, unsecured long-term debt to Baa2 from Baa1, leaving it two steps above junk-bond levels. The agency kept Enron's ratings on watch for further downgrade. 
Long-Running Concerns 

A 50% hit to shareholder value still seems like an overreaction to a 10% reduction in shareholders' equity. The stock price reflects the expectation of additional losses to be reported and Enron's loss of credibility. Enron executives in a conference call Tuesday insisted that the worst was behind them, but few on the call believed that. 
For some analysts, Enron's revelations only fed long-running concerns about the company's lack of financial disclosure. 
Cary Wasden, managing partner of Reed Wasden Research, has had a ""sell"" recommendation on Enron since March. Unlike the analysts at big Wall Street firms, Wasden isn't in the business of selling stock. His firm isn't involved in brokerage and isn't a hedge fund. Wasden gets paid for his research, and the company doesn't invest in the securities it covers. 
A main Wasden concern with Enron is that the company has regularly included the proceeds from one-time sale of physical assets in operating income. His belief is that Enron has dramatically inflated its earnings for the past couple of years - a concern to which an Enron spokeswoman couldn't immediately respond. 
""Don't believe by any means this is the end of the story,"" Wasden said. 
Wall Street sell-side analysts have largely kept Enron as a ""buy"" or ""strong buy"" as the stock fell from $90 to $20. But even they are expressing concerns about the quality of Enron's reporting. 
For now, the plunge in the price of Enron's shares and bonds, which last week started trading like junk-rated debt, hasn't hurt its credit standing with energy trading partners. 
""We haven't changed our thinking regarding Enron or our policies and practices. We're watching it, and so is everybody else, but they are a solid company,"" Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) spokesman Richard Wheatley said in a typical reaction. ""This is unfortunately a feeding frenzy regarding some dealings that I'm sure Enron will be able to come out of at some point."" 
Keeping Talent A Challenge 

Enron is a big company - far too big to ignore. But continued deterioration in the price of its shares and bonds could lead counterparties to restrict their traders' transactions with Enron. If the company's investment-grade bonds continue to trade near levels traditionally considered distressed, risk managers won't be able to ignore it, whatever else Moody's does. 
Assuming that doesn't happen, Enron still faces a tough road ahead. Like all companies, Enron is the combination of capital and talent. For financial companies, talent is the more important ingredient, and Enron has been suffering damage to its talent for some time. 
New Chief Executive Jeff Skilling left in August, and a handful of his key lieutenants left earlier in the year. The losses can be expected to continue. Much of the top management cashed out when the company's stock price was high and moved on. Now middle management on down is angry and anxious to move on, if they haven't already. 
Over the years, Enron has compensated its very talented labor with stock options to make up for base pay considered low by the industry. Those options are now nearly worthless. If Enron's debt-service costs rise, the company could struggle to attract the talent needed to generate income in its core business of trading energy in North America. 
Some analysts would like to see more turnover at the very top. When Skilling left, nobody believed Skilling or Chairman Kenneth Lay's assurances that it was for ""personal reasons."" When CFO Fastow was forced out of his position last week, Lay said, ""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO."" 
That's putting words in Wall Street analysts' mouths. Who thought scapegoating Fastow was really the answer? 
""I don't know anybody who said that,"" Wasden said. ""What did the CFO do, what did Skilling do, that Ken Lay wasn't part of?"" 
Real change will have to come from without, Wasden said. 
""Enron has been a cult, more than a company,"" he said. ""Recruiting from within does nothing to change the company, it just changes the disciples. Enron needs to pull some top talent from outside."" 
Nevertheless, Wasden thinks Enron's stock has reached its natural floor and, if the company starts disclosing how it really makes money, it can recover over time. 
""There are a lot of earnings that can be wrung out of really strong operating assets, like pipelines and power plants,"" he said. 
That means paying more attention to the assets that Enron has spent the past few years denigrating. Given the bind Enron is in, Lay won't have much choice. Enron will survive, but it won't be the same company at all.

OFFICIAL CORRECTION Enron long-term ratings downgraded to Baa2 - Moody's

10/29/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

(Moody's corrected its stance on Enron ratings to a downgrade) 
NEW YORK (AFX) - Moody's Investors Service said it has lowered the senior unsecured long-term debt ratings of Enron Corp from Baa1 to Baa2 following a deterioration in Enron's financial flexibility since the company announced significant writedowns as well as equity charges in previously undisclosed partnership investments.
The long-term debt ratings remain on review for further downgrade, Moody's said. 
Moody's also placed the company's Prime-2 rating for commercial paper on review for downgrade. 
Moody's initially placed Enron's long-term debt ratings on review on Oct 16. The write-downs and equity charges led to a substantial loss in investor confidence that has led to a more than halving of Enron's share price and difficulties in rolling over commercial paper, according to Moody's. 
In response to these events, Moody's said Enron has shored up its near-term liquidity position by drawing down on all of its committed revolving credit facilities and buying back its outstanding commercial paper, leaving the company with a net cash position of approximately 1.2 bln usd. 
Moody's said it plans to focus on management's success in lining up further liquidity support and on their ability to retain credit availability from their major counterparties.

USA: Moody's cuts Enron to 2 notches above ""junk"".

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service on Monday cut embattled energy trading giant Enron Corp.'s senior unsecured debt rating to two notches above junk status, and warned it may cut that rating again, as well as its rating for Enron's commercial paper. 
The rating agency cut Houston-based Enron's senior unsecured debt to ""Baa2"" from ""Baa1,"" and said it may cut Enron's ""Prime-2"" commercial paper rating, which affects short-term debt. Its rating actions affect $13 billion.
Moody's said Enron is suffering from deteriorating financial flexibility since it announced big write-downs and equity charges from previously undisclosed partnership investments this month. This triggered ""difficulties in rolling over commercial paper,"" Moody's said. 
Enron, which has about $63.4 billion in energy assets, said on Monday it is talking with banks to get more credit, after last week drawing down $3 billion from a bank credit line to buy back its outstanding commercial paper. 
Its shares traded Monday on the New York Stock Exchange at $13.75, down $1.75, or 11.3 percent. They have fallen 62 percent since Oct. 12, from $35.81. 
Rating agency, Standard & Poor's, on Thursday revised its outlook for Enron's ratings to ""negative"" from ""stable.""

UK: Europe energy firms wary of Enron on credit worries.
By Stuart Penson

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy companies in Europe are shying away from trading with troubled U.S. energy group Enron amid concerns about the company's credit status, industry sources said on Monday. 
Several large energy groups have frozen their dealings with Enron - one of Europe's biggest gas and power traders - as they hold urgent talks with the U.S. group about setting up new credit arrangements, the sources said.
""I think Enron's approach is to get the major counterparties back on board as quickly as possible and then hope the smaller ones will follow,"" said the head of risk management at one UK utility that halted its trade with Enron last week. 
""They are talking with us about bank letters of credit,"" he said. ""The people that are still trading with them are doing so on a very restrictive basis."" 
A spokesman for Enron's European headquarters in London headquarters declined to comment. 
Reluctance to trade with Enron in Europe comes as the company tries to rebuild investor confidence after its stock hit five-year lows. 
Triggering the slide was news last week the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating huge losses relating to a private equity operation run by its former chief financial officer. 
Houston-based Enron trades a large amount of its volume in the U.S. and Europe through its Internet EnronOnline system. 
Last Friday the company said trade on EnronOnline was above average levels with more than 8,400 transactions at a notional value of approximately $4 billion. 
Traders said Enron's plight could hit liquidity in European gas and power markets, where liberalisation has unleashed rapid growth in energy trading in the last couple of years. 
One industry source cited a brokers list showing eight companies in the UK electricity market had put on hold their trading Enron, which is among the biggest five traders in the market. 
In mainland Europe, where Enron has been a major driver of liquidity, potential counterparties are treading with care. 
""We are avoiding them as counterparties - either by not trading with them or by using a 'sleeve' (a third party trader),"" said a senior trader at one of Germany's big utilities, who declined to be named. 
French traders said wariness about dealing with Enron had dampened liquidity although Enron was still in the market on Monday morning. 
""Enron is a major player so counter parties are looking to see if there is a problem,"" said one French trader.

BANDWIDTH BEAT: Enron Puts Spotlight Back On Broadband
By Michael Rieke

10/29/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Thanks to Enron Corp. (ENE), the broadband sector again looks like a place to make money.
But it won't be traders who will cash in on this new potential. It will be class-action attorneys. They're already lining up to sue Enron in at least five shareholder suits. 
As of Oct. 25, two of lawsuits had been filed against Enron in federal court and three more in Texas state court. Most of them name as defendants Ken Lay, Enron's longtime chairman, former Chief Executive Jeff Skilling and Andrew Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer until he was put on leave of absence Oct. 25. 
Still another suit, which isn't a class action suit, was filed naming as defendants members of Enron's board of directors. 
All the lawsuits concentrate on private investment partnerships Enron set up, many of them managed by Fastow. Most of the suits contend that it was a conflict of interest to have the Fastow partnerships doing complicated hedging transactions with Enron. 
The transactions named in the lawsuits involved billions of dollars of underperforming assets in broadband, water and other Enron investments. 
Fastow operated on both sides of some of those transactions. As Enron's chief financial officer, he was being paid to manage the corporation's finances. As general partner of two LJM partnerships, he managed the counterparties to billions of dollars of trades with Enron. He shared in profits of those partnerships. 
When investors began demanding information about the transactions, Enron's share price began to slide. With the heat on, Enron recently unwound the trades with the partnerships and booked $544 million related to losses from early termination of the deals, among other things. 
That's when the class action attorneys went to work. So far, at least 14 law firms are representing the plaintiffs. Enron didn't respond to calls asking about the lawsuits. 
Among the law firms representing plaintiffs is Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, which put out a news release announcing its lawsuit. The release points out that the firm has been responsible for recovering more than $30 billion from class action lawsuits. 
The lawsuits bring up questions about the bandwidth trading market. Some of the deals with the LJM partnerships run by Fastow ""purportedly involved hedging transactions in the broadband market,"" according to Abrams and Franks v. Enron et al. 
That could tie into questions that have lingered in the bandwidth market for months. Market skeptics have said Enron and other energy companies are the only ones trading bandwidth. 
Enron has reported that it has been trading with a growing number of counterparties, a total of 120 in the second quarter of this year, according to Enron. 
Now market watchers will want to know if any of Enron's trades were done with the LJM partnerships managed by Fastow. 
They will also want to know how many bandwidth trades were done with Chewco Investments. That Houston company, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal, was managed by Michael Kopper and was set up in 1997 when Kopper was a managing director with Enron's Global Equity Markets Group. He left Enron earlier this year to work for partnerships run by Fastow. 
Do the plaintiffs' attorneys know whether Enron was trading bandwidth with any of those investment partnerships? 
""I think if is too early to tell,"" Thomas Bilek of Hoeffner & Bilek told Bandwidth Beat. ""As you know, (information) is coming out in drabs and dribbles from Enron."" 
It could be several months before plaintiffs' attorneys get a chance to ask Enron officials those questions, Bilek said. 
It's also too early to tell what potential damages plaintiffs could win, said Steven Schulman, an attorney with Milberg Weiss. ""At this point, you can only talk about it in terms of (shareholder) losses, and the losses are in the billions."" 
Total losses will depend on the price each shareholder plaintiff paid for the stock and the price at which each shareholder later sold the stock. 
Enron's share price topped out between $90 and $91 in the summer of last year. It set a 52-week low Oct. 26 at $15.04. That spread leaves plenty of room for losses. 
Schulman told Bandwidth Beat that the record for losses in shareholder cases is $11 billion in a case involving Cendant Corp. (CD). Damages are usually a substantial portion of losses, Schulman said. 
""Whether (the Enron case) is bigger or less, I couldn't opine,"" he said. ""This is a big case, by any means.""

Most of Walter Koffer's work is for the East, but Wayne pays for him because:
- the other transmission people are part of Wayne's world;
- West occassionally borrows people from Virgo - (1 person for two weeks, 2 people 2 hours a day for 3 months, etc.) and uses approximately one person-year. 

This totals 9 people for the west - one less than a moth ago (kraszewski already left the company).  No one else should be charged to the west. The west should not be used for arguing the existence of other technical people in the east.  My budget will show 8 people for tech services which means that I intend to reduce by one more - likely to occur in Q1.

PG&E Corp. announced that its National Energy Group will develop its first 
Nevada project, a 1,000 MW natural gas-fired generating plant to be located 
45 miles northeast of Las Vegas. The merchant plant's main purpose is to 
supply Nevada, but when it is not needed there, it will add much-needed 
supply to the western energy market. The group hopes to begin construction 
during the fourth quarter of 2001, with completion expected in early 2004. 
""Southern Nevada has one of the most rapidly growing economies in the 
country,"" said Thomas B. King, president of PG&E NEG, West Region. ""Because 
of its location near Las Vegas, the Meadow Valley project will be ideally 
positioned to efficiently serve that demand growth."" Including the Nevada 
project, PG&E National Energy Group has a total of 4,000 MW in development or 
construction in California, Oregon, Nevada and Arizona. ",discussion threads,10,2000,2

Here are the revised dates for the response/reply/and hearing dates for

deposition on the parties'  intention.  We should be expecting a deposition
notice soon if they are going to follow through on their threat.

I passed along to Liz Austin your request regarding pleadings A&K has filed
setting forth the Trustee's position in connection with the
enforcement/nonenforcement of the power contracts and what remedies the
Trustee is seeking.  As you see below, she is pulling those together.

Call to discuss the response to the Trustee's settlement offer.

All risk books will be run on Tuesday and Thursday of each week and P&L will be reported for those days.  

POSITIONS AND CURVES

Pending an IT solution, positions and curves will be loaded each day.  On days when the books are not run, we will use prior day information.  Per discussions with Credit, this process is sufficient for counterparty exposure reporting.

CASH FLOWS

Cash flows will be loaded on days the books are run.  Infinity will pick up prior information on days when books are not run.

Since Koch has told you that they sold the properties to Duke, I would say 
that Duke should be paying us for the gas.

I had heard that Koch sold the properties to another counterparty, but I 
wasn't sure to whom.  I either talked or left a message with someone in the 
settlements area about two months ago about this after Koch informed the 
trader that they should not be getting the invoices.  However, I never heard 
back from anyone. 

This is related to the CES acquisition which came online the first of this 
year.  The deal info we had at the time had this sale booked to Koch.  I can 
change the tickets in Sitara to the Duke counterparty (or create new tickets) 
today if you need me to, so that we can get the invoice out the door.  You 
will still need to coordinate with the contract group in getting the correct 
contract in place for the deal.

I have been billing Koch Midstream Services Co under ENA for meters 
LL-1-0030-Comitas (Sitara #144052) and LL-1-0027-Volpe (Sitara #144049).  My 
former accounting contact at Koch, Michael Thomas, said that Koch sold these 
south texas assets to Duke Energy Field Services back in 1999.  Michael faxed 
a contract which I forwarded to Cindy Balfour Flannigan in the contract 
area.  Cindy said she can't tie the deals in the contract to our system so 
she can't recognize the assignment.  Cindy has left messages with Koch, but 
she has not been able to resolve the issue.    Koch is refusing to pay for 
the gas and there is currently over a million dollars outstanding relating to 
these deals.  I need to find out whether Koch or Duke is responsible for 
paying for this gas.  Do you have any information regarding this issue?

Shona,
When we returned from Argentina we concluded that a proper risk management 
system needed to be implemented in order to posture the office for success. 
They have been trading there for over 2 years which is plenty of time to do 
so.  We used Enpower as a phrase meaning ""Proper Risk System"".  If there are 
real questions about the functionality of such, then that obviously begs the 
question as to why we allow someone to transact on behalf of Enron 7500 miles 
away that doesn't understand.  That being said Mike Guerrero seems perfectly 
hip to having the best platform available.  It was Enron NetWorks that said 
that they could implement a ""controlled spreadsheet environment"" that would 
have ALL the functionality of a proper risk system, including risk 
aggregation into RisktRAC, credit aggregation and tracking, option valuation, 
scalability, security and stability. I will not opine on such matters.  They 
must produce or stop transacting.

I believe they have implemented a secure spreadsheet environment in which to 
work.  I know I discussed this during a meeting with Ted and Donna a few 
months ago and we decided we could live with the change to a secure 
environment in lieu of a full EnPower implementation.  Although EnPower would 
be great to have, if commercial decides that the office does not have the 
transaction volume there is not much we can do.  

As I understand it, there are further issues with capturing the appropriate 
curve shift info from these offices in RiskTrac.  Let's discuss what we can 
do and what decisions need to be made.

Subject: Re: EnPower production - Argentina Power

Lavarato has stopped efforts for implementing Enpower in South America until 
business activity increases enough to support it.

Based on below, we will start looking for someone with strong Access/Excel 
knowledge to come up with a different solution.  Everyone will have to 
regroup and determine next steps and look at revised timelines.

I discussed this with John Lavorato who is now responsible for this.  He said 
don't do anything!  When their  volumes increase we can address the Enpower 
implementation again.

Subject: EnPower production - Argentina Power

Richard / Beth,  We have been asked by risk to get Argentina started on 
EnPower.  Are you OK with us moving on this?  A couple things to consider...

Our instance strategy for EnPower is determined by geographic location 
(bandwidth), volumes, and market similarity (functionality).  Based on this, 
I want to set South America up on their own instance.  EnPower will have the 
following instances long term:  EUR, US, CND, SA, AUS, JPN, IND.  We will 
continue to pursue a common code base and logical data model.

There is additional time and cost associated with setting up a new instance, 
however, I am concerned about continuing to pile new business units into a 
production environment that will eventually need to be split.

Glad to discuss...  Please respond quickly, as we are waiting to pull the 
trigger on this...

Steve

Duong,
Per our phone conversation, below is the list of people that would need 
access to EnPower production. 

User Names:   NT ID:  Extension:
Scott Mills   SMills  x3-3548

Currently, the Argentine Power group has in total about 20 physical forward 
deals  which will be done under Enron Comercializadora De Energia Argentina 
S.A.(Co. 027W) and one financial deal which will be done under Enron North 
America (Co. 0364). Given the fact that we'll also have deals on ENA, I would 
think that we could be on the Houston server. Just let us know.  
In the mean time, we'll be working with the various Global groups to have the 
proper desk, portfolio, facilities etc.... set up.

Thanks for your help,
Trang x3-6996

Dear Kathy & Darren,
     I've spoken with Marcelo Parra here in New York regarding phone 
recording for the Enron Metals offices.  The RAC group insists that recording 
is done ASAP and I need to report back to Marcelo the install dates of the 
equipment in Montreal and St. Louis.  If you have such info or know who is 
responsible, please let me know.  
     I understand that we are several months away from the installation of a 
new switch with central recording capability here at the 520 Madison office 
in New York.   As an alternative, I can install a refurbished digital 
recording system for 24 telephones on the Concentrates and Metals trading 
desks for approximately $45,000.   The recording device will be located in 
our telephone room and is not accessible to the traders.  All equipment is in 
stock and we can have the desks recorded by December 1.   I need a quick 
approval since the vendor will only hold refurbished equipment until Friday 
afternoon for us.  Barry, can you give the OK?
    Also, recording for the Chicago office should not be an issue since the 
Enron Metals people are moving to the existing Enron Chicago facilities 
before the end of the year.

Best  regards,
Mike

I read your message regarding the meeting with TransAlta and other Alberta 
marketers with interest.  My immediate thoughts are as follows.

Obviously, you should keep the discussions entirely to problems experienced 
with B.C. Hydro/Powerex foreclosure of transmission capacity.

If the project proceeds, the coalititon should appoint a limited number of 
people to carry the project and report back to participants.

The working group should ensure that their proceedings include outside 
counsel who had or have some knowledge of antitrust, as well as the 
regulatory issues.

The coalition should stay as close as possible to government.  For example, 
they should try to involve Alberta officials in the project if possible.

My guess is the Competition Bureau will take the view that regulatorys (B.C., 
NEB, FERC) have primary jurisdiction, but the Bureau may be an ally in 
dealing with regulators.  Do you know who at the Bureau TransAlta talked to 
about their concerns?  This may also have some bearing on the extent to which 
Enron should openly participate in the project.

The question is not that ""cut and dry"". However, for the month of March Enron paid Spinnaker @ IF HSC -$0.085. 
Currently the volume is posted under deal ticket  #144271 with is the deal tick for gas daily production.
This production should be moved to Deal ticket  #144264 with is the IF.

We probably should be invoicing selling to Dow at IF.  However, we should also have purchased the supply from Spinnaker (#144271 & 144264) at IF.  Did Spinnaker bill us at Index or Gas Daily?  What did we pay?  Let me know this and we can proceed from there.  Nelson Ferris did these deals.  I will talk to him after I hear from you.

Subject:	FW: March 2001 Invoice

Julie -
Please help!  Per Dow Hydrocarbon's Accountant, Marilu Trochta's e-mail below, (with attachment), there are volume and price discrepancies with what  ENA billed them and what she reflects in her system. ENA Invoice # 24636SA invoiced Dow Hydrocarbons and Resources, Inc, on CSGT @ B368-Brazos, per deal number SA639615, @ 685 per day (3/1/01 - 3/31/01) @ HSC GDP D.A. - $0.07/mmbtu. Vs. the 18,457 mmbtu @ $4.960 that Dow has and ENA did not invoice them for sales on Bluedolphin 250 and 249 vs. the 5,459 mmbtu @ $4.960 & 18,218 mmbtu @ $4.960 that Dow reflects.  I realize that the volumes ENA billed on the Brazos are estimates or noms. Problem: I need to confirm the March 2001, sale @ Brazos (volume & price) in addition to the sale @ Blue Dolphin 250 & 249 (volume & price).  Can you print the confirmations for me? Also, Sitara does not show me who the trader is for this deal, and by chance do you know who the scheduler(s) are?
Thanks,
Tess

Richard,

I have received a final bill in the above-referenced matter from Mark D. 
Gately, now of Hogan and Hartson.  Gately was the lead partner on this file 
with Miles & Stockbridge before he changed firms toward the end of the case.  
He is billing us for 6.75 hours at $325 an hour, for a total of $2,193.75.  I 
find the bill in order and ask for your authority to place it in line for 
payment.  

I have also received a final bill in the above-referenced matter from Miles & 
Stockbridge, for work done from October to date.  There are three timekeepers 
(with billing rates from $290 to $115 an hour) who charged a total of 17.70 
hours, for total fees of $4,101, and total expenses of $1,1129.30, for a 
total bill of $ 5,230.00.  I find the bill in order and ask for your 
authority to place it in line for payment.

Let me know if you wish to review either bill yourself, or whether you wish 
to pay the bills yourself.

no hi how are you doing?  no how is it going up there in portland?  you just come in and go right for the west desk's eol jugular.  

as everyone knows, the west power desk has a spotty record, at best, on maintaining eol volumes.  there are some good reasons for this and some lame, tired excuses which i'm sure we will discuss in great detail in the near future.

i currently don't get the ice reports and will make sure i am on the distribution.  from what our traders tell me and what the report that you sent indicates, ice is having an even harder time in the west than we are.  it looked like there were two one-month deals on ice that day totalling 20,000 MWh.  in contrast, we had 87 transactions totalling 269,000 mwh.  if i'm reading it right, the ice report actually makes us look good by comparison!

 =20

 Kevin,  =20

EWC requires three clarifications to the PPA in order to get the project fi=
nanced and sold.  All previously requested amendments proposed by the equit=
y purchaser have been dropped, and EWC will take the resulting pricing redu=
ction. =20

I want to make sure you understand how minor these three clarifications are=
.   These clarifications conform to the original deal and are NOT changes t=
o the deal. =20

 1.  Banking Provisions.   EWC and EPMI agreed that energy and renewable en=
ergy credits (""RECS"") produced by the Indian Mesa II wind generating facili=
ty in any year in excess of the annual minimum quantity would, on a cumulat=
ive basis, offset any deficiencies of energy and RECS in subsequent years. =
Section 4.04 of the agreement does not clearly provide the cumulative carry=
over mechanism which was contemplated by the parties. (This section origina=
lly provided for the carryover, but in an effort to simplify the language, =
the aggregate carryover concept was clouded.)  Both the project lenders and=
 the proposed equity purchaser have required that the point be clarified.  =
There has never been a disagreement between EPMI and EWC on the intention o=
f the carryover banking provisions. EPMI's most recent refusal to make this=
 clarification now appears to be a change in the original deal

 2.  Grid Curtailment EWC and EPMI  drafted the contract  with specific pro=
visions relating to  termination resulting from grid curtailment, Section 5=
.04  .  There is an ambiguity in that grid curtailment could also be covere=
d  under the termination provision relating  to force majeure under Section=
 5.02.  This  inconsistency is the problem.  Neither EWC nor EPMI were to p=
ay damages to the other party in the event of grid curtailment.  The propos=
ed equity purchasers have requested that the force majeure provisions of  t=
he PPA  be clarified to make it clear that extended grid curtailment would =
not give rise to termination payments.  This clarification is consistent wi=
th the original intent of the parties and is not a change to the deal.

 3.  EPMI Credit Support.  EPMI's obligations under the PPA are guaranteed =
by Enron.  The Indian Mesa II PPA permits EPMI to assign the PPA to certain=
 affiliates without consent of the seller.   Any assignment by EPMI would n=
ot relieve it of its duties and obligations under the contract, and the Enr=
on guarantee would remain in place.  However, the project lenders have requ=
ired clarification that the Enron guarantee would either explicitly remain =
in place or that the assignee would have a credit quality at least as good =
as Enron Corp's credit quality.  The project lender's have also requested t=
hat the termination payment provisions be clarified to provide that any sub=
stitute PPA used to calculate a termination payment would also need to be w=
ith a party that had a credit quality similar to Enron Corp's, since that i=
s the credit that is supporting the Indian Mesa II PPA.  This will not affe=
ct the value of the contract to a third party since Enron bears this obliga=
tion unless released by the project.

Under the dispute resolution provisions of the PPA we could certainly pursu=
e declaratory relief under arbitration.  Our sense is that this does nothin=
g but ensure delay.

 From an Enron perspective:

     The sale of the equity and the financing of the non-recourse debt on t=
he Indian Mesa II project is currently at a standstill due to issues surrou=
nding the ambiguities in the PPA

      While the debt financing for the Indian Mesa I project is in place (d=
ifferent offtaker) the proposed equity sale to AEP is linked to the sale of=
 the Indian Mesa II project.

     If Enron cannot move forward with the financing of the project within =
the next month, Enron will likely end up with approximately $153M less cash=
 at year end than it counted on in its plan, in addition to any decrease in=
 planned earnings

    The after-tax return to Enron in a ""hold"" situation is 0%, due to Enron=
 being in the Alternative Minimum Tax position, i.e. it cannot use the tax =
benefits.

It was clear in the discussions with the City of San Antonio that these cla=
rifications would have had no affect on value.  =20

Harvey Morris Esq.
California Public Utilities Commission
505 Public Utilities Commission
San Francisco, California   94102

  Re:   I.00-08-002  Subpoenas Served on Enron Power
Marketing, Inc. (""EPMI""), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. and Enron
Energy Services Inc. (collectively referred to as ""EES""), Enron Energy
Marketing Corporation (""EEMC""), and Portland General Electric Corporation
(""Portland General"")(collectively sometimes referred to as the ""Enron
Entities"")

Harvey,

 Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities'
production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by
the California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter ""the Commission"").
The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking its
investigation into the problems in the California electric markets by
producing the information specified on a timely basis.  We believe that the
limited production we propose will enable the Commission to commence its
investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to litigate all of
the potential objections to the requests for production, which are, by any
standard, extremely broad and could involve millions of pages of documents.
We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of October 3, 2000
with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by cooperating,
offering to produce or producing documents, the Enron Entities have not
waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that
any claims, defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise or other
responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future,
if necessary.   For all of these proposals, we exclude documents that are
protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work product
privileges.

 Generally speaking, the Enron Entities propose to produce documents
for year 2000 as noted below.  We also understand that the Commission will
be obtaining documents from the ISO and PX and we will not attempt here to
duplicate documents that we understand will be produced by those entities.
As you will see in the general documents that are offered here for
production, Enron Energy Services Operations, Inc. is the parent of Enron
Energy Services, Inc. and does not have operating authority or engage in
wholesale or retail purchases or sales of energy.  Thus, the documents
offered here with respect to those two entities originates with Enron Energy
Services, Inc. but we have designated them both as EES.  We also do not
propose to offer duplicative documents as between the Enron Entities.

GENERAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 1 through 4

 Because of the dynamic nature of the Enron Entities' businesses, the
burden and expense on them to locate, and produce every corporate
organizational chart anywhere in their organizations since April 1, 1998 is
significant.   The Enron Entities will provide the Commission with exemplars
of their current organizational charts, telephone directories and so called
""family trees"" to show its current organization.  To the extent that the
Enron Entities can readily identify and locate exemplars of significant
organizational charts, telephone directories or so called ""family trees"" for
earlier periods they will also make those available.  One Enron Entity,
Portland General, has published books on its corporate history.  If a list
of those books would be helpful, we can provide it.  With respect to the
other Enron Entities, to the extent that corporate histories can be found,
they will be produced.  We anticipate producing these documents in the first
wave on October 13, 2000.

Requests 5 and 6

 The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 will
identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction
Documents will identify its customers and suppliers.  We believe this
information will be sufficient to illustrate these relationships for the
staff's purposes.

FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 7 through 11

 The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the period
requested with respect to financial data.  EPMI, EES, and Portland General
will provide to the Commission electronic transaction data ( the
""Transaction Documents"") for the purchase and sale of energy delivered which
information includes economic data.   We anticipate producing public filings
regarding financial data on October 13, 2000 and the electronic Transaction
Documents in the second wave of document productions.

GENERATING DOCUMENTS
Requests 12, 14 and 18

 For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generation
facilities are either non-existent or limited in number and there will
probably be limited documents available.  The Enron Entities to the extent
they act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell
generation output, do not have the specific documents that pertain to each
generation unit requested.  The Enron Entities, other than Portland General,
do have documents and information for Las Vegas Cogeneration.  We propose to
produce these documents in the second wave of document productions.

  For Portland General, the production of the requested documents
would involve a tremendous volume of documents, as Portland General owned
twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during 2000.
Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about one
half of its total energy demand.  As a result, we question whether the
effort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on the
California wholesale market is necessarily limited.  In addition, those
transactions which do involve Portland General sales into California are
limited to sales to the ISO and PX, and long term contracts with two small
California municipal utilities.  Thus, the Commission will receive the
essential transactional information regarding these sales from the ISO and
PX.  Nevertheless, Portland General proposes to provide for year 2000
electronic Transaction Documents in summary form similar to the data being
provided by other Enron Entities, to the extent relevant as discussed below.
We propose that the Commission defer requesting production of other
information until it has reviewed the information of generators who sell a
significant proportion of their energy into the California market.  At that
time a more accurate assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort
will be valuable given the limited impact of Portland General generation on
the California wholesale market.

TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS
Requests 13, 15, 16, 17 and 19

 We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data for
the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX.
EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of relevant
transaction data for year 2000 (in California and outside of California and
Real Time) for the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date,
counterparty, quantity, delivery point, hours, price, and whether it is a
purchase or a sale.   Because of the speed with which you want this
information, it is possible that some entries will be incomplete or
inaccurate.  For those
transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator, we
understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction, but there will
not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly.
The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMI's
customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading
business.  EES can also provide similar data with respect to relevant
wholesale and retail transactions with the proviso that with respect to
retail transactions it will not include the specific names of its retail
customers but instead will provide a blind customer number due to EES'
confidentiality obligations to those customers.  We anticipate producing the
Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions.

FERC DOCUMENTS

Request 20

 The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received
from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies of
those responses.  We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October 13,
2000.


 Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron
Entities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on
Friday October 27, 2000.  It is possible that not all Enron Entities could
make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for
production by then.

 We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if
any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently
in place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions will be
protected by the most stringent protective order.  In addition, if, at the
request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding, the Commission or a
court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production be
limited, reduced or eliminated, the Enron Entities reserve the right to
limit the production of documents in conformance with such order.

 We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know
if they are acceptable to the Commission.  If you have any questions or
comments about our proposal, please do not hesitate to contact Michael Day
or myself.

Subject: Inventory Accounting


As follow up from our staff meeting on Monday, here's the SEC position on 
inventory accounting;

Energy trading companies that apply EITF 98-10 (which Enron does), can carry 
inventory purchased from non affiliates at fair value (spot price).  

I spoke with John Vickers and he agrees that EGM is appropriately utilizing 
fair value accounting for it's inventory acquired from 3rd parties.  We do 
need to identify situations where we acquire inventory from an affiliate and 
determine appropriate treatment.  I am aware of this situation in Crude & 
Products (Scott, I'll set up a meeting to discuss), however please advise if 
there are any situations outside of Crude & Products that may be of issue.

With gas futures prices soaring past $5, now is not a bad time to raise price 
forecasts and expectations for the coming winter and next year. Prudential 
Securities did just that yesterday, upping its predictions on spot wellhead 
prices to $4.10 for the second half of the year, $3.55 for all of 2000 and 
$3.65 for 2001. 

""[W]e believe the natural gas industry could continue its bullish run for 
another two years or more and the next 18 months look like a 'lay up,'"" the 
investment banking firm said in its latest quarterly report on natural gas 
fundamentals. Below average storage inventories and increasing gas-fired 
electric generation demand should keep the bull market running, the report 
stated. 

Prudential expects storage to end the injection season at about 2,660 Bcf, or 
11% below last year's level. ""This is assuming that the average injection 
rate is at or above the eight-year historical average during that period, and 
so far this year refills have been at or below the historical average. 
Depending on the winter weather, the industry typically consumes 2,000-2,500 
Bcf out of storage inventories, which would likely bring storage levels down 
close to record lows next spring."" 

Prudential expects supply tightness to continue even with the addition of the 
1.325 Bcf/d Alliance project, which is due to come on line next month. ""[W]e 
question whether the Alliance pipeline will add incremental supplies to the 
U.S. or simply displace gas supply out of the Alberta region currently 
flowing down the TransCanada pipeline system."" Prudential predicts Alliance 
will open up Oct. 2 with 600-700 MMcf/d of gas flowing. ""The perception of 
the continued tightness in the gas supply picture is likely to result in an 
increase in volatility in natural gas prices."" 

Prudential also estimates that 1.5 Bcf/d of gas demand has been added this 
summer by new gas-fired power plants going on line. ""Over the past few weeks, 
over 2,400 MW of new merchant capacity has been added to the grid, equating 
to about 480 MMcf/d of capacity. Earlier in the summer, 3,600 MW came on line 
and another 1,780 MW started up in May. In aggregate, about 7,800 MW of new 
summer generation load could collectively consume 1.5 Bcf/d, which is likely 
to be diverted from storage injections."" 

The firm estimates that wellhead deliverability will pick up significantly. 
The rig count has grown 48% since last year. Production from the deep-water 
Gulf of Mexico is expected to add 3.6-4 Bcf/d of new supply, ""more than 
offsetting the deliverability decline, but shy of total expected new demand. 
We forecast gas demand will rise 3.1% in 2001, fueled by growth in merchant 
power generation."" 

Prudential noted that on the books is another 37,000 MW of additional new 
gas-fired generation capacity to be installed next year and 43,200 MW in 
2002.

PG&E want to fight the TURN accounting as it, basically, wiped out hopes of 
collecting their undercollected amount from a regulatory accounting 
perspective.   The company has said they need to keep the old accounting 
convention alive, as it would bolster their chance for recovery in the 
litigation on the just and reasonable argument in Federal District Court.

If the Super Saturday occurred on a different weekend, I would help you out.  
However, we have a pretty important family weekend coming up.  Cole's 3rd 
birthday is today.  We will be doing a little celebrating with that.  Plus, 
we are putting our house on the market this week and are scheduling 
appointments to view other houses.  Anyway, I hope everything else is going

Subject: Enron Industrial Markets - Super Saturday Recruiting

I need your help!  On Saturday, 01/20/01, EIM is having a Super Saturday to 
recruit experienced Commercial Support personnel to fill many of our 
vacancies.  Unfortunately, we don't have enough personnel to do the 
interviewing.  To round out the Logistics team, I am looking for one more 
interviewer.  The current team is Roy Lipsett, Dan Hamilton and Del Davis.  
Both Dan and Del are new to Enron (Del started 1/8 and Dan is still 
transitioning his prior job and moving to Houston), but bring a wealth of 
Logistics experience for our industries.  I would love to have one additional 
team member to provide input from the Enron perspective.  Will this candidate 
fit into the expectations of Enron?  Will the candidate compete when compared 
to their peers.  Unfortunately, Logistics candidates below Manager have been 
difficult to find from the industry.  There seems to be a tendancy towards 
clerical skill sets but compensation at a Specialist level.  Consequently, I 
have been cautious around these candidates as I would not want to set them up 
to fail.

I know the sacrifice of a Saturday, but I would value the input that any one 
of you might offer.  We do expect it to be a full day commitment as we have 
several candidates, and we will have a follow-up evaluation session.  I know 
I can't adequately compensate you for your day, but I would be happy to buy 
you a dinner for two.  Please let me know ASAP.  Assuming worst case that noe 
of you are available, I would welcome other suggestions.

In advance, I appreciate your help.

Most Powerful Women in Business: The Power Fifty - Louise Kitchen No. 17

Carly Fiorina Tops FORTUNE's List of 50 Most Powerful Women in Business for Fourth Year

10/01/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 1, 2001-- 

Lower-Profile Women Topple More Well-known Names From Tech and
Internet Sector; Ranking Includes 14 Newcomers 

Though Hewlett-Packard lost $65 billion in market value in a year, CEO Carly Fiorina hasn't lost her nerve, and for the fourth consecutive year holds the No. 1 position on FORTUNE's ranking of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business. 
The complete list and accompanying stories are in the October 15 issue of FORTUNE, available on newsstands October 8 and at www.fortune.com at 12:00 p.m. on October 1. 
In the No. 2 spot is eBay CEO Meg Whitman, who runs an Internet company that actually makes money: $85 million in the last four quarters on $582 million in revenue. Oprah Winfrey, the Queen of Media, is mightier than ever, and holds the No. 3 spot, up from No. 15 last year. She produces movies, brings comfort and advice to millions of TV viewers, propels books to bestsellerdom, and, last year, teamed up with Hearst Magazines' Cathie Black (No. 28 on the list) to publish O, The Oprah Magazine-by some measures the most successful magazine startup ever. At No. 4 is Andrea Jung, Chairman and CEO of Avon, who has breathed life into ailing Avon. Mirant CEO Marce Fuller-the only newcomer in the top five-holds the No. 5 position. Inside a stodgy utility, Southern, Fuller built a high-growth trading and marketing unit, which was spun off in April. 
In these new, more tempered times, patience may be about to reap its reward. In FORTUNE's annual survey of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business, there is a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly. Says FORTUNE senior writer Pattie Sellers in ""Patient But Not Passive,"" the story that accompanies the list, ""By patience, we mean staying with a company, steadily building influence there, and rising to power through determination and insider knowledge, not promises and self-promotion."" 
Fiorina, who has claimed the top spot each year since FORTUNE's inaugural list in 1998, heads the biggest company ($48 billion in revenues last year) run by a woman. And she is still as audacious and impatient as ever. Wall Street practically heckled her latest move-a bold bet to buy Compaq-but Fiorina, 47, remains defiant. In difficult times, ""people who drive change are the subject of great scrutiny,"" she says. 
As always, the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time. Last year, power resided in the technology and Internet sectors, but that influence was fleeting. Gone from the list this year: Deborah ""Hurricane Debby"" Hopkins, who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at Lucent and lost her CFO job in May; Ellen Hancock, who failed at the startup, Exodus; and Morgan Stanley's Mary Meeker, who influenced so many to buy into the Internet fizz. But one Web warrior looks better than ever: Meg Whitman, No. 2 on the list. She has never overpromised to investors; instead she has diligently delivered above-target profits every single quarter. 
Fourteen newcomers join the list this year: Marce Fuller, President & CEO, Mirant; Louise Kitchen, COO, Enron Americas; Colleen Barrett, President & COO, Southwest Airlines; Betsy Bernard, President & CEO, AT&T Consumer; Anne Stevens, VP, North America Vehicle Operations, Ford Motor; Maria Elena Lagomasino, Chairman & CEO, J. P. Morgan Private Bank; Susan Desmond-Hellman, EVP and Chief Medical Officer, Genentech; Janet Robinson, SVP, Newspaper Operations, New York Times Co.; Carol Tomi, EVP and CFO, Home Depot; Carrie Cox, EVP and President, Global Prescriptions, Pharmacia; Carole Black, President and CEO, Lifetime Television Networks; Janet Davidson, Group President, Integrated Network Solutions, Lucent; Larree Renda, EVP, Retail Operations, Safeway; and Louise Francesconi, VP and GM, Missile Systems, Raytheon. 
While the economy and its points of power change, the criteria we use to evaluate power remains the same. Says Sellers: ""We consider the size and importance of a woman's business in the global economy, her clout inside her company, and the arc of her career-where she has been and where she is likely to go. When appropriate, we also weigh the woman's influence on mass culture and society. That factor lifts Oprah Winfrey to No. 3 on this year's list."" The shifts on our list this year are dramatic, with 14 newcomers. But one trend is especially intriguing: Women are taking on bigger businesses than ever. A few years ago, responsibility for a $3 billion business almost automatically earned a woman a spot on this list. No more. This year's FORTUNE 50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $20 billion or more, which is a first. 
In a related story, ""It Took a Lady To Save Avon,"" Katrina Brooker looks at Andrea Jung, Chairman and CEO of Avon. Says Brooker, ""Jung knows what women want and how to sell it to them. And that's what has made her one of the most successful CEOs-male or female-in recent years."" Over the past 20 months she has overhauled nearly everything about the way Avon does business: how it advertises, manufactures, packages, and even sells its products, and she has done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated Avon Lady, but by reviving her. The result: growth in revenues, operating profits, and operating margins. 
In addition, FORTUNE includes an international list of the 50 powerful women in business. The top ten, featured in the magazine, are Marjorie Scardino, CEO, Pearson (Britain); Anne Lauvergeon, Chairman, Areva (France); Mary Ma, Senior VP & CFO, Legend (Hong Kong); Marianne Nivert, President & CEO, Telia (Sweden); Lien Siaou-Sze, Vice President, Hewlett-Packard (Hong Kong); Patricia Barbizet, CEO, Artemis (France); Eiko Kono, President, Recruit (Japan): Belinda Stronach, CEO, Magna International (Canada); Marina Berlusconi, Vice Chairman, Fininvest (Italy); Christine Tsung, President & CEO, China Airlines (Taiwan). You can read about the other forty at www.fortune.com or in the international editions of FORTUNE.

about getting a prescribed job done.  I personally like Bob a lot, and am 
very interested in making sure that he is in the right role for him.  His 
wife has MS in its most severe stages.  He was a manager previously, and we 
jointly made the decision to reclassify him as a senior specialist in order 
to reduce the expectations on him in his role at work.  He needs to be able 
to leave work at a very reasonable hour each day in order to relieve a 
caregiver who is with his wife while he works.  I made a personnal commitment 
to him to make sure that his work load would allow a reasonable and 
predictable end to his work day, and as long as he is in my group I will 
personally make sure that works for him.  I would hope for him that if he 
ever considered a change that a new boss would be able to do the same.  

Danny contacted me about Bob, more from the standpoint of asking me what 
impact it would have on gas if he moved.  I suggested that Brent would be 
better able to address that.  I did tell Danny that the onslaught of EOL 
transactions has been a challenge for gas confirmations, and I am sure that 
they are not long on people.  I assume that Danny is following up with 
Brent.  --Sally

you have listed, he wants to include only Cindy Horn.  

I have thought more about Heidi Mason and Jan-Erland and think that they 
should be included.  While they do roll into Europe and also have a tie to 
accounting, they are the individuals in Sydney and Toyko that we are 
depending on to stress and enforce controls.  Heidi particularly does have 
active responsibility for risk, confirmations and settlements on a day-to-day 
basis.  And in addtion to their role reporting in to Europe, we are looking 
to them to oversee controls for other non-EEL traded commodities in their 
locations - weather, coal, etc.

I will include Fernley on the invitation list, as I had mentioned the meeting 
to him when I saw him in San Antonio.  He can certainly respectfully 
decline!

Proposed list - of all potential candidates

Myself
James New - and his lead risk managers
Mike Wellings - UK Power
Coralie Evans - Continental Power
Robert Yeo - UK and Continental Gas
Paul D'Arcy - Structured Products
David Wall - Credit
Tim Poullain-Patterson - Metals Integration
Andrew Cornfield - Metals Risk Manager
Kevin Rhodes - Metals Controller ( there are in fact two controllers at 
present Kevin for Financial Trading and Howard Carter for Merchanting )

I would leave Ralph Jaeger of Frankfurt out of the offsite if places are 
restricted  - He is covered by the mainstream Accounting conferences, but I 
would have Jan Erland, and Heidi and Tiong Hock from Singapore.

I am not sure Fernley would want to be there - but I can ask.

On others  - Simon Thurbin of liquids in london should be in Houston and 
would be a good choice for inclusion. Brent may want his two London 
controllers of Cindy Horn and Kenny Nicoll to also come

Would you invite Kristen to come with( in place of Barry? ).

A long list ( and we may want to cut back ) but all these individuals carry 
the burden of operational risk assessment and management - standardising that 
process would be an achievement indeed.

MGU, complete utility outsourcing to ENA.  Requires all gas supply and assets are bequeathed to ENA with a gas sale to MGU.  Risks to MGU include performance risk, commission scrutiny, and assets remaining with ENA for 60-90 days in the case of ENA insolvency.  They are betting the entire reliability of their utility performance to one counterparty.  That is a big bet for any company and was managed completely through TRUST...

Peoples is different.  Keyspan is different.  Their worse case is ENA goes away and they a) have more money in the bank, b) grew their diversified earnings at a pace unachievable on their own, c) will get addicted to this new business and d) have very little to loose with their alternative being partnering with our closest competitor.  The choice for these guys is to grow or not.  They will not loose what they had before ENA.

I know our role for the unforeseeable future will be that of a broker.  Even on MGU, I am attempting to find a way to mitigate their concerns with providing a third party back stop.  On Keyspan, the play is to bring them into the PEC deal linking the Midwest and the NE.  

Originators must be optimist's and I don't like letting a deal I believe in die.  MGU will be a challenge due to the commission scrutiny I may not be able to now...  overcome.  I believe more than ever we can link counterparties together and provide the backbone of some new vehicle.  Peoples has been painful and there are still challenges ahead, but they are willing to provide financial backing for money.  They have a taste ($10 MM, 2000 and $18 MM, 2001) of this new business and do not want it to cease.

So, first, I do want to move ahead with my new role and second, really want to have Keyspan and PEC together in NY.  The NY event is 2 weeks away and Chuck, Ed and Mike have committed.  For the group, I want Russell and Deirdre McCaffrey, 1 analyst and 1 associate to see if we can get anything going.  It is an investment of around $2MM to determine if we can get an asset play working.

Please reconsider the NY trip to include Keyspan and provide me the go ahead to form this group.  The below attachment is to show, with time, focus and persistence there is always a way around (or over) all problems.

Thanx,
Laura

Subject:	FW: Enovate/WPS winter deal

It looks like we may have worked out an arrangement for the WPSC deal.  Essentially, PEC will provide the full guarantee, ENA will give PEC a reimbursement agreement for 50%, and ENA will receive 50% (25% under bankruptcy) of the deal proceeds.  In exchange, we may need to cover a small (few hundred thousand dollars) shortfall on the 25th of November.  This would most likely be accomplished by not cash settling a portion of the transactions and instead delaying payment until enovate has the cash.  I am working out the details of whether or not this is feasible.  Any questions, please let me know.  I will let you know if we hit any road bumps, but we are going to try to close this by tomorrow.

Stacy - Thank you for your excellent suggestion on documentation. Hopefully, it will pass through the rest of the PEC organization.

Subject:	Enovate/WPS winter deal

As most of you are aware, enovate has been finalizing negotiations w/
Wisconsin Public Service for a winter peaking exchange (ie the non-regulated
version of storage).  This is a 16/d, 5 day peaking deal effective only this
winter.  It generates fixed revenues of appx. $250,000, plus additional
commodity charges that are minor.  WPS will not accept a PG from Enron, and
Enron can not issue an LC for their half.  WPS will accept a PG from Peoples
for the entire amount (the entire amount is $5 MM).

Enron will provide the reimbursement agreement back to PEC.  Enron has
agreed to a 75/25 sharing on this deal, which will go to 50/50 if they are
NOT under bankruptcy.  In addition, Enron is - subject to final management
approval - going to cover a small cash shortfall that enovate anticipates
having during November due to a) a net operating loss during October, and b)
completion of the $18 million cash distribution last week (Gregg and I
inadvertently sent back too much).

While this is not an ideal arrangement we feel this is appropriate given the
nature of this deal and current credit circumstances.  At this point we are
not viewing this as a template for future deals of this nature.

Please let Gregg Penman, Roy Rodriguez or myself know if this does not work.


Thanks,

--Tim

You indicated that you would be willing to provide a few bullet points

What a dreary place in the winter. I dont have much to report. I have been 
traveling a bunch--- in the last 10 days, I have been to Portland, Calgary, 
LA, St. Louis, and now London. Julie has held her tongue because of her 
impending 8 weeks in Austin this summer. The kids are great. Lots of sibling 
rivalries going

I have been biking with Garribaldi and Worscheh in preparation for our 
participation in the Houston to Austin bike tour. Garribaldi has a new job 
with a couple of big projects in the pipeline. Worscheh finally got his 
financing on his project so he is pretty chipper these days. They are 
pregnant again and out of space in their house. Missy Medary is running for 
District Court Judge in Corpus Christi. She is running as a Republican in a 
Democratic stronghold and her last name is not Perez or Medarcia so her 
chances are slim. She is hoping for a George W. Bush coattail effect. Tom was 
not all that keen on the idea the last time I talked to him. Don't quote me 
on this but I think he is worried that she is a status seeker and that she 
will have way too much of what she wants if she is elected( Judges tend to 
have a lot of people kissing their ass) Rob and Amy are just holding on with 
their 4 kids. I think Rob's job is going well: they made one large aquisition 
at the bottom of the market and commodity prices have doubled. I haven't seen 
anyone else,although I did talk to John Scott the other day. He works for a 
firm in Dallas that does alot of Enron's work. I laughed at him when he told 
me he is trying to get his kids into Country Day. He was always calling it

To: Steve Hamilton
Subject: RE: Agreement and Release of Claim

Steve,

Thank you for the offer and your follow-up phone call.
I have reviewed the offer and cannot accept it.  I am owed more than the
$44,463.88 you admit in the offer.  At this time I am not anywhere near
being agreeable to releasing ECOGAS, its shareholders, partners, or
affiliates or each of their respective directors, officers, employees,
agents, representatives, and insurers as specified in the document.
If you in fact have $22,231.94 allocated to pay me, I would strongly
encourage you to consult with counsel and then to go ahead and make another
partial payment against the ECOGAS indebtedness.  Doing so will certainly
mitigate some of the damages that have been caused by a member or members of
the group you have defined as ECOGAS Related Parties.  Put simply, the more
I receive from ECOGAS, the less I will be seeking to collect from a related
party who is liable to me.  Nothing stops you from making the appropriate
partial payment other than your continued practice of making preferential
payments to my detriment.  Until the ECOGAS Related Parties or its member(s)
are prepared to fully compensate me, I will not execute any release.  If
ECOGAS declares insolvency in the interim, so be it, I look forward to
working with the trustee to reverse the preferential payments in accordance
with the bankruptcy code.
I repeatedly advised you against making preferential payments if you had
knowledge that the company was insolvent.  In Felipe Vega's presence, I
repeatedly advised you to seek counsel.  If I should determine that you, or
any other party, in fact authorized me to perform work at a time that you or
another party knew or should have known that ECOGAS was or was becoming
insolvent, and therefore had no intention to pay for the work being
authorized, I am fully prepared to collect for any shortfall or other
damages from the appropriate party or parties.  Since the documents indicate
that Mr. Maffett stated that you and the controller knew that the company
was insolvent when you were authorizing work, I conclude that you were at
least complicit in leading me to perform work at a time that you had no
intention of compensating me from company funds.  Therefore, I must
reasonably assume, unless your intention was fraudulent, that you intended
to compensate me from your own funds, or from funds promised by another
party.
I am sure that you have been fully compensated for the time you have spent
at ECOGAS since February and I fully expect to be compensated for the work I
performed during the same period.  I recommend that you look seriously at
the path ahead, consult with your counsel, and then immediately pay me in
full.  Please let me know if you need my wire transfer instructions again.
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to continue contacting me
or to have your attorney contact me.  Since you continue to contact me and I
have received no response from Doug Daniels, I am assuming that Bracewell &
Patterson prefers not to accumulate any additional billable hours with an
allegedly insolvent client.  Doug and I had agreed not to unilaterally
notice depositions in my current lawsuit, but I need to proceed with
discovery.  I am prepared to take your deposition on any workday between
December 18th and December 29th.  I sincerely regret that the Holiday season
is going to be interrupted on this task, which regrettably will be
unpleasant, but you are one of the parties that has forced this timeline.
If Doug is to participate and still represents your company, please forward
this reply to him and then let me know what date is good for you and for
him.  If he is not going to participate, please let me know a date
convenient for you and any attorney you may be retaining.  If I do not hear
from you or your attorney, I will have no choice but to send you a
deposition notice.
By the way, my middle initial remains ""L."", not ""A.""  Some of the ECOGAS
crowd may be calling me an ""A-hole,"" but I am not an ""A. Hall""
    Best regards,

    Tom

This is a family outing with lots of activities for the kids, and you can come and go as you please.

Please make an effort to attend on Saturday, even if you can only join us for a little while.  Feel free to pass this invitation on to other executives in your business unit.  The Analysts and Associates tell us that this type of exposure to our business leaders helps drive excitement and enthusiasm within the Program.  Your support of events like this is incredibly valuable, and appreciated.

If you can join us, please rsvp to Jackie Coleman by email, or at extension x54070.

Richard,

I just found out I am going to be out of town Wed-Frid, so I won't be
available for lunch on Wed.  Can we reschedule for next Tues or Wed?

Sorry, but duty calls.

Thanks,

Rebecca

For Mobil in March, beginning on March 21, HPL started delivering 30,000/d 
for MidCon (just like we did in Dec and Jan, and maybe in Feb too)

Check with Daren Farmer when you get ready to do the flash invoice on the 
first to confirm the MidCon volume amounts and dates

Thanks!!!!!

I've been offering Paul the chance to do much more outward-facing commercial work digging into things like Huberator and PowerITS (from this morning's articles) as well as any potential sales of our platform technology in Europe.  He expresses keen interest, but his heart seems to be in Canada.  He has committed to come to some career conclusions within the next week or two.

We've also been speaking with Heather Kendall, a director who works for Gary Hickerson in London helping to roll-up the Ag business.  I've worked with her before, and she would be great for EnronOnline's efforts at gaining traction in new products, marketing and origination out of London.  Her issue is wanting to come back to Houston at some point.  I suppose I need your help in 2 ways.  First, if you know Heather and are comfortable nudging her toward our shop, I think it would go a long way.  Second, if you are familiar with anyone else in London with deep Enron background and broad commercial shoulders who's looking for an open lane, we need to talk to them.  Clearly Paul and Lara are doing a great job, but we need even more firepower over there to iron out some of the issues the desks are facing, both internally and externally.

Thanks in advance for any help you can offer,

Subject: Brandywine Meter #: 981225 ; March, 2000 Activity

There was no flow at meter 981225 for the month of March.  The HMS technician 
did contact measurement once to get the volumes zeroed out but apparently he 
will have to get with them again.  I have notified the tech and he is in the 
process of doing this.

The meter is set on pressure control and the valve is open.  Gas Control's 
understanding and the field's understanding is that at the time the 
Brandywine deal ended some sort of standby agreement was in place.  If this 
is not the case please let me know and we will notify the plant and close the 
valve.

Robert,  
 In the future if you have meters like this where there is a small flow 
volume without a nomination in place please check with Earl and myself so we 
can investigate before we get commercial involved.

Thanks

How is this meter set up?  Why would it have flowed in March?  Any ideas?  Is 
it on pressure control?  If so, what's the set point?  I need to know before 
I can go to Oxy and/or DuPont and make a claim ....

As promised please find attached the updated Capital Charge presentation for you to distribute to department heads.  I am still working on more examples to present.  I am considering the effect of the cost of capital curves in valuing option premia.  I will have to discuss with RAC.  I am setting up meetings with Risk management starting monday to see how we are going to implement the Charge in teh Book.  I will be trying to sit with yourself as well and discuss how you see the charge/benefit flowing through the different books.

We have also discussed the cost of capital concept with Joe Deffner from EGF-NA (they are working on a similar concept with Louise) and will be liaising weekly with them from Funds Flow pricing signals.

		 Subject: Enron v. Calpine


 Andy:

 To recap our conversation yesterday, here is where we stand on the Calpine
matter.

 I made our settlement offer of $1 million to Tom Ganucheau by telephone on
Friday, May 18. Tom told me that his client contact was out of the office
until May 23 or 24 but that he would relay the offer as quickly as he could.
I spoke with Tom again by telephone last week and he volunteered that he was
""working on"" getting me a reply.

 We have had 3 minor successes in pretrial skirmishing that may make a
settlement offer more attractive at this time. First, we won our motion to
compel, which requires that Calpine produce abstracts of all its power
purchase and sale agreements in all NERC regions. They had moved for a
protective order which would limit their production to the contracts in
ERCOT. Their expanded production is due June 11. Second, we won our motion
to continue or extend the deadline to reply to Calpine's motion for summary
judgment. We filed a reply anyway out of an abundance of caution, but the
court ruled that we were entitled to additional time, partly becasue of its
ruling on expanding the scope of contract discovery outside ERCOT. Our
supplemental reply to the summary judgment motion is due June 22.  Third,
Calpine lost on its motion to compel, in which they had sought an order from
the court requiring us to produce additional information on our damage
claim. You should have a copy of our reply to Calpine's motion, in which we
detailed the evidence already produced on damages. We still need to update
some of the damage claim based on information that came out in Ed Baughman's
deposition, and Bonnie is working with Doug Gilbert-Smith on this.

 Elizabeth Sager's deposition is scheduled for June 13. Jim Fallon's
deposition is scheduled for June 14. A prep session for Sager is scheduled
for June 7; a prep session for Fallon is scheduled for June 12. In addition
to the pleading and discovery deadlines noted above, we also have a pleading
amendment deadline on June 20, and an expert report deadline of June 29. We
have already met with Ron Vollmar about producing his expert report. We have
drafted an amended complaint, which we needed to do anyway since the case
was removed from state court and we were still on the state court original
petition. The amended complaint will add a specific count pleading
ambiguity/implied contract, to bolster the admissability of extrinsic
evidence, and a promissory estoppel claim in the alternative.

 I will let you know as soon as I hear anything in response to our
settlement offer, and in the meantime, please don't hesitiate to call if you
have questions or comments on any of these matters.

 Best regards,

 Bill

Hi Allan:

I  am  writing  you  to express my strong interest in working at Enron Net 
Works
International Private Equity.  I am confident that my experience has prepared 
me
with  the  broad  skills  and finance expertise necessary for success in 
Private
Equity.

The rigorous curriculum in the Anderson School at UCLA has not only confirmed 
my
interest in Finance, but also enhanced my accounting skills. After 
graduation, I
spent  the first four months of my rotation program in Enron at the Asia 
Pacific
Structuring  Group. There I honed my analytical skills, commercial knowledge 
and
cross-functional team experience through financial modeling and risk 
assessment.
I  provided  robust  analytical  support that resulted in a successful bid 
for a
$550  million  power  project in China.  In the past five months at the 
Business
Development   Group  of  Enron  Broadband  Services,  I  managed  the

Bicknell of Clyde & Co. in London.  Andrew is available for further 
consultation with you on Wednesday if you so desire.  His direct telephone #

I appreciate any help you can give us at your negotiations on Wednesday with 
Exmar.  The best of all possible worlds is if both EGLI and Exmar could agree 
to withdraw/dismiss their claims against each other and walk away from this 
case before year end.  If you wouldn't mind, I would appreciate a short 
e-mail from you regarding Exmar's response during your meeting with them.

Many thanks for your help.

		 Subject: SANTA CLARA




Britt

I would summarise the main facts/status of this matter as follows:

(1)  Enron voyage chartered ""SANTA CLARA"" from Exmar N.V. by a C/P dated 
5.2.91
to carry cargo of 4,200 mt 5% more or less at owner's option of propane, from
Houston to Dunkirk.  Under the Charterparty Enron had the option to load cargo
either fully refrigerated or ambient or chilled.

(2)  On 26th February 1991 the Master advised Enron that the maximum quantity
that the cargo could load at ambient temperature was 3,760 mt having regard to
the vessel's pressure settings and the USCG and IMO Rules and Regulations. The
Master was in fact absolutely correct but Exmar tried to make out that the
vessel could load the full charterparty quantity.

(3)  It is our case that in order to load more than 3,760 mt (the cargo was
loaded at ambient temperature) Exmar refrigerated the cargo as it came on 
board
to reduce the volume.  This caused the loading to be excessively slow.  We say
this method of loading was actually illegal.  It was only by loading illegally
in this way that Exmar could load more than 3760 mt at the required pressure
setting.  We also say it was an express term of the charterparty that the 
entire
contractual cargo could be loaded within the contractual lay time.   The 
vessel
also had to raise the temperature and discharge causing further delays.

(4) There was great commerical pressure on Enron at the time.  The market for
propane was falling rapidly in March 1991 (the end of the Northern European
winter) and Enron had arranged the on sale of a minimum quantity of 3,990 mt 
on
CIF terms based on an expected loading of 1st-7th March 1991.  Enron were
extremely concerned that this would lead purchasers Vitol  to repudiate the 
sale
contract leading to a very substantial trading loss (Vitol did try to 
repudiate
the sale contract due to the loading delays and this developed into a very 
major
trading dispute with Vitol which we eventually won in the House of Lords).

(5)  Exmar made out that slow loading was due to low back pressure in his
Enterprise loading lines.  We believe this is wrong but at this distance in 
time
it is difficult to get clear evidence.

(6)  In the circumstances, on 7th March 1991to try and speed up loading Enron
agreed that the minimum cargo of 3,760 mt should be loaded and agreed to pay
Exmar deadfreight on the balance in the sum of US$22,714.84.

(7)  Furthermore, because of the slow loading of the vessel the Enterprise
Terminal had to throw ""SANTA CLARA"" off berth.  This would have caused a very
substantial delay and might have justified Vitol in throwing  over the sales
contract.  In the circumstances Enron negotiated an agreement with another
vessel (""DONAU"") to permit ""SANTA CLARA"" to be loaded ahead of ""DONAU"".  The 
sum
paid to ""DONAU"" amounted to US$153,472.15.    We believe the ""DONAU"" was also
operated by Exmar.

(8) Accordingly, Enron deny liability for demurrage for the extended loading
which Exmar have claimed in the sum of US$165,652.78 and Enron have
counterclaimed a total of US$176,186.99 (i.e. the deadfreight and ""DONAU""
payments).

Exmar are represented by London Solicitors, Lawrence Graham where the matter 
is
being handled by Mike Lax and his assistant Stuart Dench.

Lawrence Graham have always sought to charactercise this claim as a
straightforward demurrage dispute and suggest that we have invented the
technical arguments after the event.  However, we consider there is merit in 
our
case and that if the arbitrators properly understand the expert evidence we 
have
reasonable prospects of successfully defending the demurrage claim and
establishing the counterclaim.  There is of course however an inevitable
litigation risk in pursuing the matter to an arbitration and we have, to some
extent, been inconvenienced by the loss of our original expert, Mr Ivor 
Jorstad,
who sadly passed away earlier this year.   Also some costs will be 
irrecoverable
(if we win approximately two thirds of our costs should be recoverable).

If you have any further queries, please do not hesitate to ring me and I would
of course be pleased to speak to Wayne Perry when he is in London if he needs
any further information to assist in negotiations.

Best Regards.


Andrew Bicknell

=09I spoke with George today about whether Enron would be amenable to discu=

that we would be interested but this interest was subject to the following =

Subject:=09Sempra Litigation/Conversation with Michael Goldstein

=09Michael Goldstein called this morning to discuss the way forward in ligh=
t of the Rev. Proc. and its recent amendment.  After apologizing for being =
tardy in returning my calls, he explained that, in his opinion, the tax adv=
ice that we received evidences a fundamental misunderstanding of the situat=
ion.  First, he stated that he has been advised that the Rev. Proc. does no=
t apply retroactively and that although it requires a new PLR to make chang=
es going forward, it will have no impact on activities which occurred prior=
 to its issuance and, therefore, has no impact on whether synfuel created b=
efore the Rev. Proc. qualifies for the tax credit.
=09He also noted that, to determine the capacity issue, one needs to look a=
t what could have been produced by the facilities as of the ""in- service"" d=
ate. This level of capacity is the benchmark for what can be produced. Acco=
rding to Goldstein, the level of production at Somerset was well below the =
capacity on the ""in-service"" date and, therefore, their proposed modificati=
ons to the facilities would not have increased the capacity in any way inco=
nsistent with the intent of the Rev. Proc.  When asked what he believed to =
be the rated capacity of the facilities on their ""in-service"" date, Michael=
 didn't know.  He has agreed to find this number and get back to me.
=09After I explained my understanding of the effect of the Rev. Proc., Mich=
ael kindly suggested that we consider talking to Price Monford (sp?) at VE =
who he considers to be one of the inner circle of tax experts familiar with=
 Section 29 and the discussions with the Service and the Treasury Departmen=
t about it.  I told him that we had consulted with our own experts and I di=
dn't know if this fellow was one of them.  He said that he had not talked t=
o Price and had no idea what he would advise.
=09Goldstein stated on several occasions that he thought the Rev. Proc. wou=
ld serve as a great facilitator to get the parties talking again in order t=
o mitigate damages.  He stated further that he was actually looking forward=
 to teeing up the remaining machine at Pier IX and, even, moving the second=
 machine back to Virginia.  When asked what was happening with the machine =
at Pier IX, he indicated that it remains idle because they can't get a sour=
ce of coal for it. I told Goldstein that I would visit with the ""Coal Guys""=
 about whether there was a way that we could continue to work together in l=
ight of everything that has happened.  He said that he didn't think this wa=
s going to be a problem since once things were up and running, there wouldn=
't be much occasion for the parties to have sufficient contact to yield a p=
roblem.  I suggested that if there was a way forward, we needed to make sur=
e the parties were on the same page about the Production Test, coal size, e=
tc. and even suggested a modified dispute resolution process should issues =
arise during the course of performance. I think that Sempra is amenable to =
an trying to reach an agreement going forward but I expect that absent a me=
diation or something extraordinary, we will end up fighting about November =
through the date of any deal going forward. Please note that I made clear t=
hat I had no idea whether Enron wanted to have anything to do with Sempra o=
n this deal outside the courthouse but that I would inquire.  I told him my=
 personal view was that, no matter how strong we felt our case was, I would=
 always listen to a settlement plan if they had one.
=09Finally, I told him I'd get with you guys and call him later today or to=
morrow so that he'd know whether it was worth having any additional discuss=
ions. Please give me call when you get a chance.  It might be a good idea t=
o set up a call later this afternoon if you are available.

Louise--Enjoyed talking with you. We're inviting our Summit speakers and
panelists to invite a guest for Thursday evening, as follows.....ignore the
Aug. 13 deadline, but please let us know as soon as you can. Thanks!....

Louise--We're so looking forward to seeing you at the FORTUNE Most Powerful
Women Summit, and we'd like to extend an additional invitation: Would you
like to have a notable Los Angeles-area woman as your guest for our gala
evening Thursday, October 4? The dinner, at the Ritz-Carlton in Pasadena,
will include our keynote session with Jack Welch and also a special
performance by Tracey Ullman on ""Women of Style and Substance.""

The idea here is two-fold: to give speakers like you the opportunity to
include a special guest in one of the highlight sessions of the summit, and

Hi Tammie,

Nice to speak with you this afternoon.

As I mentioned, currently Sloane Apartments do not have a two
bedroom apartment available from January 1 - 5, however they feel
that it is likely that a cancellation may come in which would allow
them to accommodate Ms Nettleton.

In the meantime, they shall be pleased to reserve a one bedroom
suite plus an adjoining deluxe double bedroom at their sister
property Parkes Hotel in Knightsbridge.  The rate per night of
Slaone Apartments 2 bedroom apartment is GBP195 per night, and
although the rates at Parkes Hotel is considerably higher, they will
be pleased to reserve both the suite and double bedroom for the
same rate.

Parkes Hotel is located at 41 Beaufort Gardens, London SW3.
Below is a brief description plus I have attached a few pictures.
Could you please confirm that Ms Nettleton would be happy to
accept the suite and deluxe double bedroom at Parkes Hotel and
should a two bedroom apartment become available at Sloane
Apartments they will amend her reservation.

There are three MG offices in North America outside New York which, previous 
to the acquisition by Enron, acted much as trading offices. They are very 
small.
We have worked with the people in Metals to put in place extra controls so 
that they are not trading offices, for example having a trader in a 
designated Trading Office own each book and sign off on profit daily.
This process has highlighted the fact that our non-trading offices are not 
all the same, and cannot reasonably all be the same.
Some offices organise logistics things to happen on the ground, some 
originate (get a price from a Trading Office for every deal), and some 
execute for Trading Offices (are given a range within which they can execute 
trades).

 is a suggestion for how we can make this division explicit.
Tab 'Office Models' shows which functions are performed in which type of 
office
Tab 'Office List' shows the actual offices involved 
We propose to re-examine this methodology in 6 months' time.
Buy-in has been obtained from the cc list and the people on the ground.

It is worth noting that this approach would have caught Helsinki, except for 
the Contract-in-a-bottom-drawer, but no system of control can reliably catch 
that, as was evidenced by EOTT.

Are you both happy with this approach?
Are there any extra controls you would like to see in place?

Got your note.  I am not incredibly attached to Commercial Support and I agree that overall it probably sounds second class.   Professional Services sounds fine to me.

Subject:	Proposal to Change ""Commercial Support"" peer group label to ""Professional Services""

At the VP PRC meeting last Wednesday, Dave Delainey proposed we consider retitling the Commercial Support peer group as above. Apparently this suggestion was made and broadly supported at a policy committee meeting a few weeks ago. The suggestion is that the Support label is seen rather negatively across the organisation and the new label may be an improvement.

The VP PRC Committee resolved that they would be open to supporting a change, subject to the senior leads from across CS providing their views/support.

I volunteered to circulate this note to the 2 of you in EWS and ask my colleagues from HR to share with their CS leads to solicit their views before returning to the committee late next week with summarised reaction. Perhaps you would provide me with your views and a vote for or against? 

I would strongly recommend that we do broadly discuss this outside a small circle of people.

We mostly have price differences, but one deal needs some days added.  Let me 
know if you need copies of the invoices.  The meters below are delivery

billed $0.10

The recently concluded 12th Session of the Subsidiary Bodies in Bonn, the 
next-to-last negotiating session before the details of the Kyoto Protocol are 
scheduled to be finalized in November, made little progress on key issues. 
But the meetings did serve to highlight divisions within the three 
negotiating blocks and identify the most contentious areas for future 
discussion.

Summary:
The retail energy industry and the Internet are becoming increasingly 
interlinked. The past 12 months have seen the formation of a wave of new 
retail energy businesses seeking ways to utilize the Internet to create a 
""new"" retail energy industry. The difference is that this ""new"" industry will 
invert the energy supply chain and be built from the demand side (customer 
end) back upstream. This fosters a new role for customers and their 
relationship with suppliers, an expansion in the number and types of products 
and services being offered, and a change in the composition of the companies 
involved in this segment. In this Private Report we analyze these new 
entrants, their business models, and the prospects for success in what to 
date has been a difficult marketplace.

The last remaining obstacle to the Blue Stream gas pipeline project between 
Russia and Turkey appears about to be cleared away. Over the past two days 
the Turkish parliament has been debating a key tax protocol connected to the 
project. CERA believes the measure is very close to passage, as the Turkish 
governing coalition has successfully resolved its internal differences over 
Blue Stream.

Summary:
The proposed directive on renewables issued by the European Commission on May 
10 may appear to be a weak compromise between widely divergent interests. 
Rather, CERA sees the proposal as a potentially important building block for 
a competitive market in renewable energy sources; the establishment of a 
method for guaranteeing a renewable origin for energy lays the foundation for 
green energy markets in the medium term.

Summary:
Colombia is expected to begin an economic recovery in 2000 after a 
contraction of over 5 percent in 1999. Despite this expansion, unemployment 
levels will remain stable at 19 percent, and losses incurred by companies, by 
individuals, and by the government through lower tax revenues during the last 
nine quarters of negative economic growth will not be recovered this year. 
The administration of Andr,s Pastrana Arango faces the difficult challenge of 
getting the economy back in shape at a time when his popularity is waning.

Summary:
The opening of Brazil's upstream oil sector has taken another step forward 
this week following the successful ANP auction of 21 blocks. This bidding 
round comes one year after ANP's first round, held in June 1999. The bid was 
well subscribed by 44 companies that were qualified to participate and bid 
for the 10 onshore and 13 offshore blocks throughout nine basins in Brazil. 
Although the ANP collected lower participation fees than in the first round 
(US$9.0 million compared with US$9.8 million in the first round), the second 
round was generally considered a success.

Summary:
Brazil's power demand grew rapidly throughout the first quarter of 2000. 
February demand was 6.8 percent over February 1999 levels, and March demand 
grew a further 7.6 percent above the previous year. The industrial sector 
continued to lead the recovery with year-to-date demand growing 9.8 percent 
over 1999, and commercial sector demand growth remained strong at 7.5 percent 
over a similar period. As demand growth strengthened, hydro power generation 
increased while thermal generation levels declined steadily from a peak in 
January. Hydro stored energy levels had begun to decline in all regions by 
the end of April, signaling the end of the wet season. With rapidly 
increasing demand, particularly in the South and Southeast regions, Brazil 
could experience power shortages during the coming dry season if capacity 
additions that are currently scheduled to come online in the next several 
months are delayed.

Summary:
July 2000 marks the second anniversary of the widely publicized visit of then 
President-elect Andres Pastrana to elderly guerilla chief of the Armed 
Revolutionary Forces of Colombia (FARC), Manuel Marulanda. Two years later, 
the country is no closer to peace, and resolution of the ongoing negotiations 
is uncertain at best. This prolongation and stagnation of the peace process 
has had a direct negative impact on energy sector investment in Colombia. The 
government will likely proceed with formal negotiations, but time--and 
Pastrana's remaining term in office--is running out.

Title: Argentine Power Markets: Winter Constraints Push Prices Higher in May

Product Line: Latin American Energy

http://www.cera.com/client/la/alt/063000_16/la_alt_063000_16_ab.html

Summary:
Prices in the Argentine power market were significantly higher in May owing 
to the combination of continued low hydro output, strong demand growth, and 
periodic constraints on natural gas deliveries to power plants in the Buenos 
Aires region. Spot power prices (energy component only) averaged $18.24 per 
megawatt-hour (MWh) in May. Although average power prices declined from last 
year, price volatility increased, with several short-duration episodes of 
prices over $60 per MWh as gas unavailability in the Buenos Aires region 
forced several midcost units offline during peak hours. In June, prices are 
expected to continue strengthening to the $24-$28 per MWh range on average. 
Beyond June, price pressures are expected to remain negative as increasing 
hydro output, new and returning low-cost thermal capacity, and the end of gas 
constraints push average prices back toward $15 per MWh or below by August or 
September.

Summary:
The US gas market enters the month of June with prices at the highest level 
since deregulation. At the Henry Hub prices have surged to as high as $4.50 
per MMBtu--up from less than $3.00 per MMBtu during April. Behind this has 
been a building and serious shortfall of supply, the result of disappointing 
gas production levels and surging gas demand for power generation. The gap 
between these two forces has been met through storage inventories, with 
injections so far this spring running between 1.5 and 2.0 Bcf per day below 
last year's rate. The continued tension between these two forces will keep 
the pressure on prices this summer, and the need to inject gas into storage 
will price out increments of demand.

Summary:
Pressure remains extremely strong in the United States gas market as three 
factors--the increasing power generation demand, lower storage inventories, 
and US wellhead supply still struggling to rebound--call into question the 
ability to build storage to a level adequate for next winter. Prices are 
being supported also by concurrent strength in oil and liquids markets, 
making traditional alternatives to gas much more expensive than in recent 
years. In this environment intense competition between power generation 
demand and storage injections will continue throughout the summer--with 
pressure increasing into July as temperatures rise--with the result that gas 
will continue to price at the high levels necessary to discourage end-use 
demand. CERA expects a July average price of $4.45 per MMBtu.

Product Line: North American Gas

http://www.cera.com/client/nag/db/061500_18/nag_db_061500_18_ab.html

Summary:
As US supply declines and demand grows, current high gas prices are 
reinforced, but western Canadian gas supply growth appears to be faltering 
when it is needed most. Both transitory factors and enduring trends underlie 
the disappointing production growth results. The largely weather-related 
transitory factors have had a near-term impact on drilling and connection 
activity. The underlying trends have been developing slowly over time. More 
shallow gas wells have been drilled in the past three to four years and 
created a shift to higher average basin declines and lower average per well 
production rates. Thus more shallow wells are needed just to replace 
production. With a shift to more exploration and deeper drilling, higher 
supply growth rates are possible, but if that does not occur, other potential 
supply sources may step in. Significant Arctic reserves in the McKenzie Delta 
and the Alaskan North Slope are once again entering the spotlight. Coal bed 
methane has become a str!
ong source of US supply. Although now ignored in Canada, it may become a 
future source of Canadian gas.

Summary:
Fundamentals have taken center stage, as building demand pressure accompanies 
US supply declines. Storage inventories have been significantly reduced, and 
the pressure for storage injections is likely to intensify as we head into 
the summer months. Demand-driven growth continues, as completions of 
gas-fired power generation plants accelerate to a pace above 10,000 megawatts 
per year and economic growth stimulates electricity demand. The result is a 
higher-price playing field for natural gas, with the average Henry Hub price 
likely to reach $3.67 per MMBtu for 2000--its highest level since the 
development of spot markets.

Summary:
The stock market has been delivering an unsettling message to the utility 
industry. Traditionally undervalued in the market, the sector is trading at a 
historically wide 50 percent discount to Standard and Poor's S&P 500. The S&P 
Utility Index over the past 18 months gained only 5 percent, with huge gains 
by some energy companies offset by a 15 percent drop in stock price for 29 
electric utilities. Yet early this year, the SPU outpaced all other industry 
groups. How should constantly evolving utilities in this wide-open sector 
form a strategic plan to maximize shareholder value while achieving success? 
The value of electric utility merger and acquisition deals for 1999--a record 
$50 billion--was double the 1998 value. But are these choices ahead of the 
curve? And when will the market catch up? Three groups of new companies with 
distinctive strategies may provide clues to the new strategic landscape: 
multiservice and technology providers, superregionals, and global power and !
energy companies. Three other strategic choices are considered in evaluating 
responses to these challenges.

Price Volatility

http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/nap/db/062200_18/nap_db_062200_18_ab.html

Summary:
While several regional power markets are likely to see a repeat of price 
spikes this summer, other markets are likely to see a reversal in price 
volatility as supply-demand balances improve dramatically. One way to 
interpret forward markets is as a consensus of market expectations. 
Therefore, forward prices for on-peak wholesale power reflect the common 
expectation that prices will spike as high as--or even higher than--in 1999. 
A significant disconnect exists between the forward market prices and market 
fundamentals for the upcoming summer in some regional markets.

Summary:
Spurred by supply concerns at the start of the summer driving season, spot 
gasoline-to-crude oil price differentials on both sides of the north Atlantic 
have soared to the highest levels seen since the Gulf War. In CERA's view, 
this strength in margins is attributable to the convergence of three factors: 
very low inventories, tightening gasoline specifications, and legal 
uncertainty.

Summary:
The US gasoline market exhibited exceptional strength during May. US Gulf 
Coast unleaded gasoline surged to $8.40 per barrel measured against WTI, up 
$3.58 per barrel over the strong April value of $4.82. Apparent demand for 
gasoline skyrocketed to 8.64 million barrels per day (mbd) in response to the 
start of the summer driving season. Despite increases in the reported demand 
for distillate and jet/kerosene, these markets did not experience the same 
month-over-month strength in differentials, dropping to $1.58 and $2.58 per 
barrel versus WTI, respectively.

Summary:
As higher crude oil prices started to reduce the high product differentials 
to Brent and thus lower refinery margins, refiners attempted to prevent this 
situation from worsening by reducing throughputs. However, very tight markets 
for gasoline and to a lesser extent for automotive diesel helped to limit the 
fall in those products' values. Meanwhile, fuel oil discounts to crude oil 
widened in May, driving down simple/hydroskimming margins.

In recent weeks, the combination of lower primary products inventories and 
reductions in operations at some refineries has helped differentials to 
recover. This has pushed margins to above May's averages, although still 
below April's peaks.

Summary:
The close scrutiny that federal reformulated gasoline (RFG) now faces from 
the media and public officials owing to Midwestern market price spikes has 
not stopped the inexorable political progress toward eliminating methyl 
tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) use in the US gasoline pool. Additional 
signposts, including heightened congressional debate over legislation 
eliminating MTBE use and state actions to ban MTBE, continue to emerge that 
point the way toward MTBE-free gasoline in the United States.

Summary:
Refined products markets continue to display marked regional differences. In 
the Atlantic Basin, low gasoline inventories in both the United States and 
Europe, which resulted from many months of OPEC production restraint, 
continue to dominate the market, and gasoline differentials above crude are 
at their highest level in over ten years. Although signs are emerging of a 
possible correction in the North American market in the coming month, the 
2000 gasoline season will almost certainly be the strongest experienced by 
Atlantic Basin refiners in many years. In contrast, Asia Pacific spot 
refining margins were weak through most of June, until the recent accident at 
KPC's Mina al-Ahmadhi refinery prompted a quick strengthening in prompt 
Singapore margins. However, with ample unused refining capacity available 
east of Suez and the likelihood of a partial restart of the KPC refinery in 
July, CERA's outlook is for that strength to be of short duration.

Summary:
In the West, July typically marks the start of the summer cooling season and 
steadily rising power prices. CERA expect the West to be the only region in 
North America with a year-over-year increase in peak electricity demand. 
Power prices already established new record highs in June, suggesting that as 
demand reaches its peak in the coming months western power markets will 
continue to experience increased volatility compared with last year's levels. 
The convergence of higher gas prices, growing power demand, and reduced 
hydroelectric energy production compared with 1999 levels is pushing up 
western power prices. Greater utilization of gas-fired generators within the 
West has supported western differentials and contributed to high gas prices 
throughout North America. Western gas prices should continue to be strong, 
boosted by continuing increases in regional gas demand for power generation 
and pressure across North America to inject gas into storage in anticipation 
of summer !
power loads.

Summary:
Driven by strong demand--especially in the recovering Asian economies and the

Summary:
OPEC's agreement to raise its production quota beginning July 1 by 708,000 
barrels per day to 25.4 million barrels per day is consistent with its 
strategy of restraining supply to maintain oil inventories at relatively low 
levels. The gain in supply is a short-term fix meant to alleviate political 
pressure for increased production and to push prices below $30 but keep them 
in a mid- to upper $20s range.

The Rofr option, which grants the shipper the right to lock in the 
transportation rate (max rate) for next
a few years, is priced as a spread swaption. 

I priced two scenarios for you:  the strip starts 1) Nov.1-00 and 2)Nov. 1-01.
For the first one I assume that the shipper makes decision on Oct. 31,00 (54 
days  to maturity)
and  on Oct. 31,01(419 days to maturity)  for the second case.

The second case has longer time to expiration, therefore larger option time 
value. See the attached
spreadsheets for more detail.

Let me know if you have any questions.

2000-09-22 18:41:00+00:00,frozenset({'bryce.baxter@enron.com'}),frozenset({'sally.beck@enron.com'}),beck-s,"The cause of this was the timing of when SAP went down.  SAP had a major 
system crash the day Willie finaled his supply verification in Unify.  Before 
Willie went into SAP to net the payable (same day), SAP crashed.  By the time 
SAP came up, the treasury run had already picked up the payable and wired the 
cash.  When we issued the recall, the money was already out the door.

As a result, we put a policy in place that all supply verifications for 
netout customers must be overridden as soon as they are finaled in Unify.  
This causes them to be blocked in SAP and not picked up by treasury until the 
payment block is removed.  This policy went into effect at the beginning of 
September.  

However, this still relies on human intervention to ensure the procedure 
works.  To ensure we don't ""accidentally"" release cash, I have asked Unify IT 
to change the interface to send all purchases for ENA to SAP blocked, which 
will require the coordinator to release funds.  This is an added step, but is 
worth it considering the stakes.  This change will go into effect on Monday, 
9/25.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Are you aware of the problems with SAP?  This error caused an incremental 
$600,000 credit loss to Perry Gas Companies that could have been prevented.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Russell - as I remember, Willie finaled the Supply Verification and it was 
interfaced to SAP.  This is fine, and then Willie was going to net the A/P 
and A/R.  SAP went down after the statement was interfaced, but before Willie 
was able to block or net the payment.  When SAP came back up the next day, 
the payment had already gone out and we were unable to recall the wire.  If 
you have any further questions about this, call me.  Thanks.

Willie,

Per our earlier conversation, can you or Audrey or Bryce, please give further 
explain to me as to why the funds were wired to Perry Gas for purchases from 
the counterparty instead on netting the amounts between purchases and sales.  
You mentioned to me the process of overriding the counterparty's that net on

Thank you,

WELCOME TO THE eXPATRIATE ZONE

Welcome to the ""First"" Issue of ""The eXPATRIATE ZONE,"" the official
newsletter of the new ""eXpatriate ZONE"" web site. After publishing ""The
Temperate Zone"" for the past two years, I'm taking the opportunity to join
forces with Bob Segel who has been publishing ""The Coconut Modem"" with Karen
Coyne since April of 1994.

Last year, after operating in AOL exclusively, Bob created ""Parrotkey.com""
out on the ""Internet"" where it would join it's sister site on AOL and be
accessible to all Parrot Heads. At the time Bob expanded ""PK,"" we had been
working on my little area of ""Club St. Somewhere,"" and the new
""Parrotkey.com"" seemed like the perfect place to open the doors of the Club.

While we were talking about the direction we wanted to see ""Club St.
Somewhere"" and ""Parrot Key"" go, we could see that this was the perfect chance
to, as Emeril says, ""Kick it Up a Notch.""
Jimmy Buffett's music was a big part of our lives, but even more so was the
""Expatriate Lifestyle"" he sang about. A lifestyle that includes tropical
travel, sailing, boating, parasailing and surfing, and yes, the music and
lyrics of Mr. James W. Buffett.

So it is, that we created our new web site, ""The eXPATRIATE ZONE""
<http://www.expatriatezone.com>, along with this newsletter of that same
name. In December, ""The eXPATRIATE ZONE"" opened its doors with its ""Island
Trading Post"" with its Holiday Shopping Service at the ""Island Trading Post.""
Over 3,600 people visited the site the first day, and daily prizes were
awarded for the first two weeks. The ""Island Trading Post"" will open again
soon, offering a complete line of tropical items, not just to those of us
that live a few blocks from Wal-Mart, but also for those of us lucky enough
to be on a sailboat or living on an island. For not, we'll start with the
""T-shirt of the Month."" <http://www.eXpatriateZONE.com/islandstore>
We want ""The eXPATRIATE ZONE"" to not only keep you entertained and informed
while you toil away at your everyday ""Corporate Gig,"" but it will also get
you ready for that day you finally shuck it all and disappear down into ""The
eXPATRIATE ZONE.""

We hope you all enjoy our new effort, and also continue to visit ""Parrot Key""
and ""Club St. Somewhere."" Both of which will be closely associated with ""The
eXPATRIATE ZONE"" and ""Parrotkey.com.""

""EXPATRIATE OF THE MONTH""
JAMES ""SUNNY JIM"" WHITE

When I first ventured on the Internet in 1995, I ran in to a guy named ""Sunny
Jim"" who was living down in the Cayman Islands. We never really got a chance
to connect, for which I am truly sorry. But, when something is supposed to
happen, it usually does.

On the first leg of my ""Road Dawg"" Tour <http://parrotkey.com/stsomewhere>
(click on ""Road Dawg"") I stayed with my good friend Alex & Janet Leist and
their wonderful children. Over the five days I stayed at their house, Alex
and I listened to a lot of music, and one of the guys we both liked was
""Sunny Jim."" I bought one of James' CDs from Alex, and fell in love with it
immediately. The CD was his second, called ""Life in the Laid Back Lane.""

Little did I know that I would meet up with James and his roady ""Shady Floyd""
several times over the next six months. James was embarking on his first real
tour of the US since he moved ""down island"" almost twelve years ago. We got
several chances to talk over the summer, and we will have an in depth article
about this ""Expatriate"" soon on ""The eXPATRIATE ZONE"" web site. Be sure to
watch for it.

In the meantime, here are a couple of quick things I learned about this great
musician. When I asked him about his ""Expatriate"" status, his reply was,
""Technically, an expatriate is someone who lives outside their own country,
for whatever reason. For some it's legal reasons, others just because they
want to, or that's where the work is. I have been an expatriate for nearly
twelve years now. I have pretty fully lived the whole Caribbean experience,
from climbing the coconut trees and spear fishing, to sailing, scuba diving,
hot afternoons on the beach and romantic moonlit nights under the swaying
palms.""

Even as James is about to repatriate himself and his family, I ask if there
were any other places he would consider living as an expatriate? ""Maybe
somewhere on the coast of Mexico or in a group of islands that are all within
sailing distance of one another,"" was the advice he gave.

Until we can learn more of ""Sunny Jim's"" world, stop by his web site at
<http://sunnyjim.com> and if you don't have one of his CDs, Including his
latest release ""Sandbar Serenade,"" for goodness sake, pick one up. You can
also read a great interview Alex conducted with James at
<http://members.xoom.com/_XOOM/LooneyMon/interviews/sunnyjim.htm>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------

TRAVEL INTO ""THE ZONE""
""Some are running from the IRS""

We strongly believe that we all have to get away from our computer screens
and out into the real world as often as we can. Does this mean we give up one
our most useful tools of communication, computers? Heck no! With laptops,
cell phones and GPS systems, we can go anywhere, and still stay in touch if
we feel the need. But get real and throw that ""Pager"" away as soon as you can.

We hope to keep this section current and informative, hopefully hearing from
those of you already living your lives in ""The Zone,"" helping the rest of us
prepare for our getaway from the cities. I'm sure there are some of us that
are preparing to ""disappear"" to places like Costa Rica, where the ""The
eXPATRIATE ZONE"" will become an important tool.

How would you like to check out a place to ""disappear"" to and write it off
your taxes at the same time? Want to go down into ""The Zone"" to places like
the Bahamas, Belize, St. Croix, Puerto Rico, Bonaire, the Dominica Republic
or Saba? Want to do something for the planet, work with dolphins, save a
coral reef, or study monkeys and the rain forest at the same time?

Well we have the answer. Check out these organization's Web Sites, and then
get some advice from your financial advisor on 501C non-profit organizations.
Depending on the tax bracket you're in, Uncle Sam could end up paying for up
to half the trip.

After that, all that's left is to make that plane reservation, and remember,
""No Plane on Sunday.""

""jimmyDOTcom""

After many delays, ""jimmyDOTcom"" has finally gone to the printer with a due
date of the middle of April. I hit some ""bumps in the road"" on my way to
publishing the first ever book about the Parrot Head Phenomena, but it was
all worth it.

This book isn't about Jimmy Buffett, it's about the effect of the Internet on
Parrot Heads. For more information, visit <http://www.jimmyDOTcom.com>. We
have a complete outline of the book, reviews from other Parrot Heads, and
samples of the pages on the site.

Financial considerations have limited the first printing to 1,000 copies at
the present time, so if your even thinking of buying a book, I suggest you
reserve your copy by putting your name on the ""Reservation List."" You will be
under no financial obligation. It will simply indicate to my financial
partners (who aren't Parrot Heads), just how many books we need to print. Do
it right away, because pre-sales were brisk, and if enough of you reserve a
copy, I can get the financing to expand the first printing.

Let's show the world what Parrot Heads stand for by making this book a big
success. When I was on the BHOTM Tour this summer, I had many people tell me
they wanted to buy an extra book to give to their boss. They wanted the boss
to understand why getting the day off for a Buffett Concert is so important.
Maybe it will help the rest of us to explain ourselves to our friends ""that
just don't get it.""

Here's one of the latest reviews of the book from Bob Robinson, Founder &
President of the Sandlapper PHC in South Carolina. I had a great time with
this club on the ""Road Dawg"" Tour, and shared an advance copy with his club:

""When we received Jackson's plea for pictures, our members were blown away.
We hustled up a package of pix, as did a majority of the Parrot Head clubs
from around the globe, and the result is pure Parrothedonistic pleasure. This
collection is bound for glory in the annals of island time. If moderation is
your key to life then stay away from JimmyDotCom, 'cause this book is packed
with those stories only we can tell.  Congratulations BubbaFreak!""

CLUB TRINI UPDATE

Speaking of expatriates, how about the guys who play the true music of ""The
Zone?"" Club Trini's long awaited Live CD will finally be coming out this
April, one year after it's recording. Jimmy has been keeping Mike and Robert
pretty busy, so it's understandable that it took awhile. It will be the third
in the ""Margaritaville Cafe - Late Nite"" series. I can't wait to hear it, as
my wife and I were some of the lucky ones who were in New Orleans when it was
recorded.

You can get a look at all the songs included on the new CD at Club Trini's
revamped web site at <http://clubtrini.com>. Along with the great songs we've
become accustomed to, are a few I'm pretty excited about. If you haven't
heard CT's version of ""African Friend"" you're in for a real treat. Along with
that, is a song that Tina and Nadirah have been treating audiences to this
past summer, ""Cario"" and Bob Marley's ""No Woman, No Cry.""

At the new web site, fans can ""now"" order their favorite Club Trini CDs using
their credit cards. So there's no excuse to not owning everything available.
I think a true ""Expatriate Musical Library"" is incomplete without Club Trini.

This summer, Helen Hiatt, Jimmy and The Coral Reefer's Wardrobe Designer,
came up with a shirt that Club Trini members lovingly call the ""Ice Cream
Vendor"" shirt, which they wear out front at the start of the concert. OK,
Pete sometimes forgets his, and when he does have it on, it lost it's sleeves
somewhere along the way. There's a great design that has been applied to a
T-shirt that we all can own. Check it out at their site.

JESTERS AND FRIENDS
NOTE CARD SERIES

Tro-Pics <http://Tro-pics.com> has just released their first Note Cards
Series from their ""Jesters and Friends"" Original Oils. Friends, places and
musicians from past years have inspired these cards and Parrot Heads and
Expatriates alike will want to have these great looking cards for those times
when an email just isn't personal enough.

The Original Artwork is also on sale at this site, so be sure to stop by and
visit them. Included in the ""Jesters"" Series are our good Friends Tim Glancey
and Wally Nickel.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------

MILLENNIUM CHANGE BUBBA STYLE

I've got to tell you, I wasn't buying into this ""New Millennium"" thing, one
bit. In fact, I had almost decided not to go to the Buffett New Year's Eve
Show. Nothing to do with Jimmy, but I just didn't get the whole hype. But at
the last minute, I had a change of heart.

And now after being a special guest at Seagram's Party honoring the new
Margaritaville Tequila, I'm sure glad I went. The shows kind of melded
together for me, making the Millennium change over very special.

If you want to hear more about this or see some pictures of both, visit our
new ""The eXPATRIATE ZONE"" web site at  <http://expatriatezone.com> and go to
the web version of this newsletter.

FLASH!!!  ""EXPATRIATED PHANS"" SPOTTED SOUTH OF THE BORDER

After making both of ""Tropo Travel's"" previous trips down to Cobo San Lucas,
Mexico, I had to miss this year's trek due to my being with the ""Beach House
on the Moon"" Tour on it's Florida, New Orleans and Houston swing.

As the story goes, those bad boys and girls from ""The Expatriated Phan Club""
<http://u1lvcm.com/gst/expat> showed up again, mainly for the T-shirts that
said, ""Too Much Tequila...Or Not Quite Enough"" on the back. Who are those
people anyway? Whenever I go to their web site, all of them have black bars
covering their eyes. If you want to see pictures of the trip or need info for
""Down to the Banana Republics - 2000"" visit <http://tropotravel.com >Mike
Mclain also has some other great trips planned this year, check them out.

Speaking of ""Tropo Travel,"" if you need a hotel room for the Vegas or Irvine
Shows and want a great deal, visit there site for some great rates. I'm
joining some of my Parrot Head friends at the ""Key Largo,"" though I'm kind of
afraid to be in a town like Vegas with Sue and Ponch Aprea from the Detroit
PHC. I'm joining a lot of my other friends I met on the road there too. I
hate seeing Jimmy in Vegas, but I've got to keep the streak alive, and seeing
all my Parrot Head friends will make it all worthwhile. I hope Peter Mayer
ends up playing there again this year.

And speaking of those great T-shirts, we have some neat shirts available at
the ""Island Store."" They're similar to the shirt you got if you went on this
year's trip, except they have ""Tropo Travel's"" seaplane on the back and the 
""No Bad Days"" logo on the front breast. You can see a picture at
<http://www.eXpatriateZONE.com/islandstore>.

PARROTHEAD PILOTS ASSOCIATION

Here are a couple of tidbits for your ""Airplane Nuts"" and pilots out there.

A new online friend who's a Medivac Chopper Pilot is trying to start a Parrot
Head's Pilot's Association. If you're interested, contact Dan at
<Medcopter1@aol.com>.

I also ran across a really cool page that features Jimmy's ""Hemisphere
Dancer"" including it's ""Jamaican Bullet Hole."" Ed Booth, Jr. an attorney from
Jacksonville, Florida, who belongs to ""Lawyer-Pilots Bar Association"" is the
webmaster and creator.

The web site is ""GRUMMAN N928J"" (Flashback - How many of you remember the TV
Show 'Whirly Birds'? Wasn't their number N975B?) and is at
<http://lpba.org/buffett.html>  It shows a lot of pictures of Jimmy's 1954
Grumman I think you'll enjoy.

Now all we need is for these guys to team up with the Parrot Heads Pilot's
Association.

ubject: RE: Legislative Report (07/20/2001)=09



Dear all,

Attached is this week's legislative report.

This entire week has been focused on devising a ""solution"" for the energy
crisis in addition to negotiating the passage of the state budget. Although
the Democratic leadership of the Assembly and the Governor successfully
lobbied four Assembly Republican lawmakers to switch sides and vote for the
budget on Monday, the four Republicans have refused to vote for five crucia=
l
""trailer"" bills which are necessary to implement the budget bill. There are
approximately 18 trailer bills that must be passed in addition to the budge=
t
bill, but 5 have raised concerns for the Republicans:  SB 767 Transportatio=
n
Funding Shift, SB 735 Elimination of School Facility Fee Housing Programs,
SB 1041 Omnibus Health Trailer Bill,  AB 144 Public Social Services and SB
79 Omnibus Social Services Trailer bill.  Senate President pro Tempore John
Burton has stated that they will not vote on the budget bill in the Senate
until the trailer bills are approved by the Assembly.  As of 7:00 p.m.
tonight, there is no budget deal.

Meanwhile, on the energy front, the four proposals we have been discussing
all week -- SB 18xx (Burton), SB 78xx (Polanco), AB 82xx (Keeley) and AB
83xx (Wright) -- are still ""in play"" legislatively this evening, even thoug=
h
the governor told the Dow Jones Newswire earlier today that the proposals
are not acceptable to him in their current form and encouraged the Assembly
and Senate to stay in session (despite the scheduled summer break) until a
bill acceptable to him could be agreed upon by the two houses and sent to
him for signature:

*=09SB 78xx (Polanco) Electric Utility Rate Stabilization Act of 2001
passed out of the full Senate on Friday with 22 AYES and 17 NOES.  The
originally introduced version of SB 78xx reflected the terms of the origina=
l
Memorandum of Understanding (""MOU"") negotiated between Governor Davis and
Southern California Edison (""Edison"").  It was recently amended to reflect
Senator Sher's proposed ""Plan B"" of the MOU -- a version of the MOU opposed
by Edison on the grounds that the bill would not leave Edison creditworthy.
It was heard in the Senate Energy, Utilities and Communications Committee o=
n
Wednesday where it failed on a 4 AYES and 3 NOES vote.  Reconsideration was
granted, however, and the bill passed out of the committee with 6 AYES and =
2
NOES on Thursday morning. The authors took up amendments such as striking
the urgency clause, changing the rate component from 125 KWs to 500 KWs,
placing conservation lands into land trusts and deleting Section 399.26
(which insulated Edison International from certain claims) during the
Thursday hearing.  SB 78xx was then passed out of the Senate Appropriations
Committee on Thursday with 7 AYES and 3 NOES.

*=09SB 18xx (Burton) Department of Water Resources: electricity: bond
financing order passed out of the full Senate on Friday with 35 AYES and 2
NOES, making it possible for DWR to issue bonds at a lower, cheaper rate
than allotted in AB 1x (Keeley) assuming the Assembly concurs and the bill
is signed by Governor Davis.  The bill also prohibits any additional charge=
s
such as consultants and ad campaigns unless approved by the Legislature and
requires certain ""sunshine"" provisions for greater scrutiny of contracts
entered to by the DWR.  We understand that J.P. Morgan and Lehman Brothers
-- the firms working with State Treasurer Angelides on the bond offering --
have advised the governor's office that SB 18xx could delay the issuance of
the bonds indefinitely for a variety of reasons, so it is unclear whether
this bill will ever be signed.  The bill was heard by the Senate Energy,
Utilities and Communications Committee on Thursday where it passed with a 1=
0
AYES and 0 NOES vote.  It next must be heard in the Assembly.

*=09AB 82xx (Keeley) Electric Utility Rate Stabilization Act of 2001
passed out of Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee Wednesday
evening on a 11 AYES and 9 NOES vote.  It was then heard later the same
evening by the Assembly Appropriations Committee, where it was passed on a
11 AYES and 6 NOES vote.  This is the ""compromise"" bill we have been
discussing all week authored by Speaker Hertzberg and Assembly Member Fred
Keeley.  The bill continues to be a work in progress as we write this
report, with significant amendments being considered and awaiting a vote by
the full Assembly, possibly later this evening.  The current version of the
bill provides for limited direct access, state purchase of Edison's
transmission lines for $2.4 billion, a minimum 30 percent ""haircut"" for the
major generators and a ""trust"" to cover all claims not dealt with by the
haircut option.

*=09AB 83xx (Wright) Alternative Electric Utility Rate Stabilization Act
of 2001 was amended into AB 50xx (by Assembly Member Bill Campbell) in the
Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee Wednesday evening, and the=
n
passed out of committee with 11 AYES and 9 NOES.  It next must be heard by
the Assembly Appropriations Committee, barring a rule waiver.  No such
committee hearing is scheduled at this time.  Co-authored by Assembly
Members Rod Wright, Keith Richman, Joe Canciamilla and Bill Campbell, the
bill would allow the utilities to impose a basic monthly charge to address
the net undercollection, among other things.


Other energy-related developments this week include:

*=09SB 84xx (Burton) State Energy Resources Conservation and Development
Commission passed out of the full Senate on Friday with 30 AYES and 1 NO an=
d
sent to the Assembly. This bill provides $10 million from the state General
Fund to the California Energy Commission (""CEC"") to fund a matching grant
program for a battery backup power source for LED traffic signals. The gran=
t
program will be administered by the CEC, in consultation with local
governments, and will provide 70 percent of the cost of the battery backup
system.  It next must be heard in the Assembly.

*=09The FERC is expected to consider disbanding the current ISO Board
for an independent slate of directors on Wednesday, the FERC announced on
Friday.   Despite a Dec 15, 2000, FERC order requiring the appointment of a=
n
independent governing board for the ISO, the state has refused to follow th=
e
order citing that only the state legislature can change the composition of
the board. Supporters of the FERC order argue that political appointees
should not oversee power markets due to the state's domineering role in
purchasing power on behalf of the beleaguered utilities.

*=09SB 85xx (Burton) Electrical restructuring: rates passed out of the
full Senate on Thursday with 37 AYES and 0 NOES.  This bill bars the
California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) from raising rates back to th=
e
pre-10 percent rate reduction levels solely because the mandatory rate
reduction period has expired on March 31, 2002.  It next must be heard in
the Assembly.

*=09The Senate gave authorization to the Senate Select Committee to
Investigate Market Manipulation on Thursday to subpoena top energy company
executives to provide testimony and further insight into their companies'
trading practices.  The resolution -- SR 14 -- passed out with 28 AYES and =
6
NOES.

*=09The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation voted
unanimously on Wednesday to ask the full Senate to find Texas-based Reliant
Energy in contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena for documents.
Despite Reliant's having handed over 10,000 documents, the committee
rejected them after being unable to reach agreement over the confidentialit=
y
of Reliant's documents. The committee stepped back from its contempt vote
last week against Enron after the company and committee moved closer to
agreement over its release of thousands of documents stored in Texas.
Mirant resolved its pending contempt citation by agreeing to turn over
subpoenaed documents.  The contempt citation against Reliant will be
presented to the full Senate, and then immediately sent to the Rules
Committee for another hearing before the full Senate acts, Dunn said.

*=09The state's estimate of being overcharged for electricity dropped
from $8.9 billion to $6.1 billion after a FERC judge ordered a readjustment
in the state's figure on Wednesday.  Although the state continues to argue
that the $8.9 billion figure is correct, FERC Judge Curtis Wagner called th=
e
figure ""baseless"" and criticized the California delegation for ""not
negotiating in good faith"" during the recent settlement discussions.  The
new amount, $6.1 billion, does not include power sales to municipal
utilities and alternative energy suppliers -- two entities that do not fall
under the purview of the ISO, PX or the state DWR -- as well as applies FER=
C
price controls imposed June 19 and retroactively takes into account sales
from October 2 onward.

*=09AB 28xx (Migden) Electrical restructuring: Oversight Board: ISO
passed out of the Senate Energy, Utilities and Communications Committee on
Tuesday to Senate Appropriations with 7 AYES and 0 NOES.  It was amended by
the author in committee to ""double-join"" it to SB 39xx (see below).  This
amendment ""ties"" the ultimate fate of AB 28xx to the fate of AB 39xx, unles=
s
the double-joiner language is removed from the bill before it goes to the
governor for signature, assuming the bill gets to the governor.

*=09SB 39xx (Speier) Public utilities failed to pass out of the Assembly
Energy Costs and Availability Committee on Tuesday with 7 AYES and 10 NOES.
Reconsideration for the bill to be reheard in the committee was granted to
the author.  Given the failure of SB 39xx in committee, AB 28xx is
effectively ""dead"" as well for the moment (see discussion of AB 28xx above.=
)



Best regards,
Tom McMorrow and Mike Martinez

Status Report re: tape transcripts

At this time, this summary has been sent to you only.

Counsel for Powerex has indicated that he now has instructions to share with 
us the information that has been seized from their offices by the Bureau in 
exchange for our providing similar information to them.

He has also indicated to us that between the 19th and the 25th of October, 
the Bureau came to Vancouver and listened to the Powerex tapes using Powerex 
equipment in that they had been unable to listen to them with their own 
equipment.

As you are aware, the tapes seized from the Enron offices in Calgary cover 
the period of September of 1999 to the end of October.

The tapes which we have listened to, but which they have not seized, cover 
the period commencing in late May of 1999 to September, 1999.

With respect to the tapes that they have seized, initially we exerted a claim 
of privilege to all of the tapes.  The Bureau has now come back to us and has 
asked us to clarify how we would propose resolving the privilege question.  
We have volunteered to have this discussion with them, but to this point in 
time, they have not responded to us.

If, as and when the conversation occurs, our position will be that we intend 
to claim privilege with respect to conversations with lawyers only.  How this 
particular aspect of the matter would be resolved is not as yet clear.

Our view is that with respect to the conversations they have, they are not 
particularly damaging but the conversations do not particularly add to the 
flavour of the matter to our benefit.

On Wednesday of next week, we will be meeting with counsel for Powerex to see 
exactly which conversations they have delivered to the Bureau.  We will 
advise him of the conversations that have been taken by the Bureau from our 
offices and at the conclusion of this matter, we should be able to see 
exactly what it is that the Bureau has in terms of conversations between 
Powerex and Enron.

We look forward to discussing this matter with you at your convenience.

I absolutely agree with you about the panels the last two years -- they have been weak.  I think, though, that this should be looked at a little differently.  The purpose for this is to highlight the operations of our business and to showcase the next level of leadership.  I think rather than just focusing on one or two businesses, this format will allow us to hit each of them at a high level.  Mark will introduce each of you, talk a little about your backgrounds to help the VPs get familiar with our new leadership, and interject questions and generate discussion as appropriate.  To be honest, I see it as ""rapid fire business unit presentations"" as opposed to the typical panel.  

Let me know if you get a different sense from Mark.

Best,
Terrie

I'll talk to Frevert but I really thought the panel session last year was incredibly weak and don't think something of that format should be pursued again.  I would hope for a major change in format.

Yes, partly.  I saw John last week and he told me that his wife was due to deliver their second child on November 9 and he would possibly miss the conference.  However, I know Mark was also interested in having women represented and liked having both you and Janet on the panel to balance things out.

I know you'll do a great job -- you always do!

Subject:	Management Conference - Business Unit Panel


Hello All,

I'm planning the agenda for this year's Management Conference.  I've been working on the upcoming meeting since March, but as you can imagine, the direction has changed several times.  

We are delighted to have General Norman Schwarzkopf delivering a keynote address on leadership, and Gary Hamel returning to help us process the past year.  While we have arranged an all-star line up of outside speakers, we also want to focus on what is happening inside Enron.  Rather than having only one or two business presentations, Mark Frevert has opted to moderate a panel to provide a high level overview of each of our primary operating units and has selected each of you to participate.

Currently, the panel is scheduled to take place 8:00-9:30am on Friday, November 16.  Please plan to present a very high level overview of your business.  You are welcome to use PowerPoint slides, but in the interest of time, presentations must be no more than 10 minutes.  Mark will introduce each of you, interject questions, encourage interaction, and ensure we stay on time. 

Below is the proposed order for your presentations.  Regardless of your place in the rundown, you will need to be seated on stage by 7:50am and equipped with a microphone.  Because we have a full agenda that morning, we will try to begin the session promptly at 8:00am.

Stan Horton - Global Services
Louise Kitchen - Americas
John Sherriff - Europe
Mike McConnell - Global Markets
Jeff McMahon - Industrial Markets
Janet Dietrich - Retail

If you elect to use a PowerPoint presentation, please forward it to me electronically by Friday, November 9 or provide the presentation to me on CD at the Management Conference.  To ensure consistancy, I've attached a PowerPoint template that I would like you to use.  

 << File: Sample Bullet Slide.ppt >> 

Finally, Mark would like to meet with the six of you to finalize preparation for the panel at 4:00pm on Wednesday, November 14 following your arrival at the Management Conference.  The meeting will take place in the Library off the Main Lobby of the Westin La Cantera.  In the meantime, if you have any questions or need any assistance, please contact me.  I look forward to working with you.

summer of 1994?!  I know that sets some kind of record at Enron!!  It is kind 
of fun to be up here.  The appreciation for the jobs that we do in operations 
has grown over the last several years, thanks to the hard work of you and so 
many others.  

My family is doing great.  The children start school tomorrow.  Meagan will 
be a junior in high school -- we took a brief trip with her this summer for 
an early look at some colleges.  It will be a big year for Amanda -- she 
starts junior high in 6th grade.  And Tyler would tell you proudly that he is

involved with the Entex contract valuation.  Dave Baumbach has been the real 
key to providing the data, and has all of the information.  Steve Jackson is 
talking with Ed McMichael of Structuring on Monday to get some additional 
eyes and resources looking at this also.  I feel we have done a thorough job, 
but we do need everyone thinking of ""what if's.""  Our risk books are complex, 
with many hand-offs internally.  Obviously our goal is to ensure that all of 
the stones have been turned, and there are no surprises at the end of the 
day.  I think Structuring will really be helpful in this arena.  After our 
meeting yesterday, I believe everyone is much more comfortable in our 
approach.  There were a couple of things that Dave was going to follow-up on 
(Fixed-price deals, especially Calpine).

Richard,

I have attached an e-mail forwarded to Claude Chandler (FM Global) in 
response to an earlier e-mail from him and another e-mail received last 
Friday stating their new position.  I will also send to you the e-mails from 
Claude I mentioned in the preceeding sentence.  

I will follow this with a phone call to you this morning so I can bring you 
up to speed on the activity associated with this insurance claim.  One item 
that needs your immediate attention is a provision in the Insurance Policy 
that could hamper our ability to litigate if this becomes our only viable 
alternative to resolve the differences.  There is a deadline for litigation 
tied to the date of the initial failure (one year which would make it June 
15, 2001).  It also requires that prior to litigation, the parties need to 
first resolve through dispute resolution/arbitration.  It has been my 
experience that arbitration normally takes 90-120 days.  There is only one 
defined action with days attached to it in the policy (60 days to establish 
reps for each party).  I think you see the dilemna.

I look forward to our discussion.

Thanks, Ron.

Claude,

In regard to your e-mail dated February 7th, we will be sending to you 
(tomorrow for overnight delivery) documentation in support of our claim and 
responses to address other open issues as stated in your e-mail.  The 
information will address the following:

Previous detail and summaries of the original insurance claim amount of 
$6,452,318.02
New detail and summaries for Enron's current position, including --
detailed labor breakdowns for services provided by Elliott and NEPCO.  This 
will identify labor hours and charges by: day, craft, individual, rate 
classification if applicable (i.e., straight time, over time and double 
time), etc.
Support for overhead charges applicable to NEPCO's billing
Support for other charges associated with Unit I claim not previously 
identified (i.e., insurance for the repair period for Unit I)
Detail and summaries of other NEPCO services provided but not associated with 
Unit I repair/claim
Letters or documentation in support of major scope differences

Note: The detail related to the NEPCO charges will follow (by end of this 
week). 

In addition, I spoke with Grady James, the Doyle Facility Plant Manager, and 
he indicated that the ""System 700"" documentation prepared by NEPCO was made 
available to you at the site.  This documentation was provided along with the 
Unit 1-3 refurbishment documentation.  Fortunately, this information 
continues to be maintained at the site and is available for your review (at 
the site) if you wish.  In regard to other documentation or notes, the 
information forwarded by Russ Porter in early February should have satisfied 
all previous requests.  If there is a specific request beyond what we have 
already forwarded, we will respond accordingly.

You also indicated in your e-mail a desire to directly contact 
sub-contractors to discuss their scope of work.  As a result of 
confidentiality provisions within the service agreements, I would request 
that you indicate to me who you would like to contact and we will provide the 
necessary waivers to those parties.   

Last, we just received your e-mail (dated Friday, Feb. 23) related to FM 
Global's current position.  Obviously we are disappointed that the two 
parties are this far apart.  Can I assume that this position reflects 
everything you characterized as outstanding in your e-mail (i.e., awaiting 
signoff from Charlie McCorckle and others)?  I assume we will have questions 
as we continue to review the material.  Should we forward those to you?  

Please call me if you have any questions or comments on 713-853-9298.  
Thanks, Ron.

HPL should be retaining at a compressor or zone to make sure we recoup our 
fuel cost ?  Also, could allocated fuel cause a contract imbalance?  I think 
that Pipeline Operations can handle the scheduling of third party fuel 
retainage.  But, if we retain fuel on ENA transports, then we need to come up 
with a plan to nominate this in Marketing Operations to Houston Pipeline.  
Currently, this process is not in place.

Brenda,

As you know fuel is a big risk.  One of the things we are trying to do is get 
the shipper to pay fuel.  This would mean we would purchase, transport and 
possibly sell gas with a fuel percentage as part of the price.  Can the 
downstream systems, scheduling etc handle this?

This change went in for the Deal Validation group.   It gives them the 
ability to change counterparties names after bridge back.

Impact to Logistics - Unify
If a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge 
backed, it could cause problems on EDI pipes as that new counterparty name 
will flow over to Unify and repathing should eventually take place.
One problem may be with the Imbalance data sets, which are not in production 
yet......(EDI Imbalance Qtys would not match up to paths)
This may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities (especially where 
nominations were sent for entire month)
can't remember the rules on this one, but I think Unify does have some safe 
guards (idiot proofs) to force re-pathing.
Unify does have the ability to over-ride duns numbers, yet would still cause 
an additional step for EDI the scheduler would need to think through in order 
to get a clean quick response.
What are (if any) impacts to Vol Mgt if counterparty name changes take 
place?  (prior periods?  re-pathing?)

I have a call into Diane and Dave both.  After speaking w/ them, hopefully I 
can get a clear understanding of the true impact.  I am sure we'll need to 
put some processes and procedures together for Deal Validation to follow when 
these type of changes are needed.

Subject: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to Assignment)


Regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in SITARA with 
confirmed volumes - Tom's words of caution:

If someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the 
ability for you to invalidate the deal - and 
then change the counterparty - however - I did add a warning message:

""Warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure 
pipeline allows this change.""   

Some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is 
feedback - I assume for the same reasons
we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems 
(pre-UNIFY).  Some pipelines will require a new 
deal and we will have to zero out the old deal.

Before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just 
in case it causes problems with their
pipeline.   Sorry - I don't know which pipes these are - you will have to ask 
the UNIFY team.

There is one rule still in place - you can change from ENA-IM East to ENA-IM 
Market East - but not from 
ENA-IM Texas to HPLC-IM HPLC - when changing business units - they must be 
the same legal entity. 
""Warning - not the same legal entity""

Also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to Service deals 
(Transport Capacity, Storage, Cash Out).
Once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules.  Don't forget - the items 
were locked down for a reason.
 If you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down 
data that was validated - and someone used these
deals in UNIFY - it is highly likely that the UNIFY deals and paths created 
using these deals will get corrupted.  Always check 
with someone from UNIFY to make sure no one used these deals for anything in 
UNIFY.

Subject: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to Assignment)  

With the release that was put out Tuesday evening, Deal Validation should be 
able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other 
than expected (e.g. confirmed, nominated, scheduled, etc.).  

In addition, this release will also capture ""near-time"" the contract changes 
that are made in global.  This means that need for server bounces will not be 
necessary.

 New/Changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal 
manager.
 New Counterparties, and new/changes to facilities will require getting out 
of all active Sitara apps (except for launch pad).  
  Once out of all apps, start a new app - the respective information that you 
are looking for will appear.

I mention ""near-time"" because we are constrained by the amount of time it 
takes for the change in Global data to trigger an alert for Sitara who then 
updates its information

There is a slight problem however, I couldn't find the deals for July and

the deal 269123 in for May 1999, but it is also in for July and November of

inadvertently put it in for July and November 2000?  If so would you put it

Meter 5192.  I never heard back from Aimee on which Transport contract to 
attach the deal 269123 to so for the months in question the gas is still 
allocated to the Strangers Gas contract.  Aimee is out on vacation until 
mid-June so I put in a call to Daren Farmer to find out which Transport 
contract I should attach the deal 269123 to.

When I find out which transport contract to use I will set up the accounting 
arrangements and then get Robert Lloyd to put the contract in POPS and 
reallocate.

Subject: 



I have just learned of another lawsuit involving CGAS.  This had been
handled by Jud Scheaf and had been dormant for a long time, which is why
neither I nor anyone at the company knew about it.

This is somewhat confusing, so let me try to explain.  The style is
Kilbarger Construction vs Eastland Energy Group, et al.  In the Court of
Common Pleas of Muskingum County, Ohio  Case No. CH96-0311.

CGAS had a lease in Muskingum County.  Eastland Energy had a lease on an
adjoining tract.  Eastland approached CGAS about going together to drill a
well on a unit formed by the two leases.  CGAS agreed.  Eastland was
designated operator.  Eastland hired Kilbarger as the drilling contractor.
Kilbarger drilled the well and it was dry.  Eastland thought Kilbarger
negligently drilled the well, so Eastland only paid Kilbarger half the
drilling cost.  Kilbarger filed a mechanics lien and filed suit against
Eastland for the other half of the drilling costs (approximately $30,000)
and also joined CGAS because of the mechanics lien.  Kilbarger was not
seeking any monetary recovery from CGAS, and the lien is meaningless since
CGAS has since released its lease.  Thus, we have no pending claims from
Kilbarger.

However, in the same case Eastland and CGAS have a claim pending.  During
the drilling of the well, some of the contractors would not work for
Eastland since they did not know Eastland - a new, small producer.  Those
contractors therefore did the work on the well for CGAS, billed CGAS, CGAS
paid those contractors, and CGAS then invoiced Eastland.  Eastland did not
pay and therefore CGAS has a claim in this suit against Eastland for
$7,139.69.  No monetary claim has been made by Eastland against CGAS.

I just learned of this case and have taken over this file from Jud Scheaf.
There is a settlement conference scheduled for December 9 and this case is
set for trial on December 16.  I am hopeful this will be resolved before
trial.  If there are questions, please call.

3.  Litigation and Other Contingencies

Litigation
=09Enron is a party to various claims and litigation, the significant items=
 of which are discussed below.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron =
believes, based on its experience to date and after considering appropriate=
 reserves that have been established, that the ultimate resolution of such =
items, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse i=
mpact on Enron's financial position or results of operations.

=09In 1995, several parties (the Plaintiffs) filed suit in Harris County Di=
strict Court in Houston, Texas, against Intratex Gas Company (Intratex), Ho=
uston Pipe Line Company and Panhandle Gas Company (collectively, the Enron =
Defendants), each of which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Enron.  The Plai=
ntiffs were either sellers or royalty owners under numerous gas purchase co=
ntracts with Intratex, many of which have terminated.  Early in 1996, the c=
ase was severed by the Court into two matters to be tried (or otherwise res=
olved) separately.  In the first matter, the Plaintiffs alleged that the En=
ron Defendants committed fraud and negligent misrepresentation in connectio=
n with the ""Panhandle program,"" a special marketing program established in =
the early 1980s.  This case was tried in October 1996 and resulted in a ver=
dict for the Enron Defendants.  In the second matter, the Plaintiffs allege=
 that the Enron Defendants violated state regulatory requirements and certa=
in gas purchase contracts by failing to take the Plaintiffs' gas ratably wi=
th other producers' gas at certain times between 1978 and 1988.  The trial =
court certified a class action with respect to ratability claims.  On March=
 9, 2000, the Texas Supreme Court ruled that the trial court's class certif=
ication was improper and remanded the case to the trial court.  The Enron D=
efendants deny the Plaintiffs' claims and have asserted various affirmative=
 defenses, including the statute of limitations.  The Enron Defendants beli=
eve that they have strong legal and factual defenses, and intend to vigorou=
sly contest the claims.  Although no assurances can be given, Enron believe=
s that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material ad=
verse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

=09On November 21, 1996, an explosion occurred in the Humberto Vidal Buildi=
ng in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The explosion resulted in fatalities, bodily =
injuries and damage to the building and surrounding property.  San Juan Gas=
 Company, Inc. (San Juan Gas), an Enron affiliate, operated a propane/air d=
istribution system in the vicinity, but did not provide service to the buil=
ding. Enron, San Juan Gas, four affiliates and their insurance carriers wer=
e named as defendants, along with several third parties, including The Puer=
to Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, Puerto Rico Telephone Company, Heath =
Consultants Incorporated, Humberto Vidal, Inc. and their insurance carriers=
, in numerous lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Pue=
rto Rico and the Superior Court of Puerto Rico.  These suits seek damages f=
or wrongful death, personal injury, business interruption and property dama=
ge allegedly caused by the explosion.  After nearly four years without dete=
rmining the cause of the explosion, all parties agreed not to litigate furt=
her that issue, but to move these suits toward settlements or trials to det=
ermine whether each plaintiff was injured as a result of the explosion and,=
 if so, the lawful damages attributable to such injury. The defendants agre=
ed on a fund for settlements or final awards. Numerous claims have been set=
tled and ten cases involving 19 plaintiffs are scheduled for trial in the U=
nited States District Court beginning on December 10, 2001.  No cases have =
yet been scheduled for trial in the Superior Court.  Although no assurances=
 can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters=
 will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or resul=
ts of operations.

=09Trojan Investment Recovery.  In early 1993, Portland General Electric (P=
GE) ceased commercial operation of the Trojan nuclear power generating faci=
lity.  The Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC) granted PGE, through a g=
eneral rate order, recovery of, and a return on, 87 percent of its remainin=
g investment in Trojan.=20

=09The OPUC's general rate order related to Trojan has been subject to liti=
gation in various state courts, including rulings by the Oregon Court of Ap=
peals and petitions to the Oregon Supreme Court filed by parties opposed to=
 the OPUC's order, including the Utility Reform Project(URP) and the Citize=
ns Utility Board (CUB).

=09In August 2000, PGE entered into agreements with the CUB and the staff o=
f the OPUC to settle the litigation related to PGE's recovery of its invest=
ment in the Trojan plant.  Under the agreements, the CUB agreed to withdraw=
 from the litigation and to support the settlement as the means to resolve =
the Trojan litigation.  The OPUC approved the accounting and ratemaking ele=
ments of the settlement on September 29, 2000.  As a result of these approv=
als, PGE's investment in Trojan is no longer included in rates charged to c=
ustomers, either through a return on or a return of that investment.  Colle=
ction of ongoing decommissioning costs at Trojan is not affected by the set=
tlement agreements or the September 29, 2000 OPUC order.  With the CUB's wi=
thdrawal, the URP is the one remaining significant adverse party in the lit=
igation.  The URP has indicated that it plans to continue to challenge the =
settlement and the original OPUC order allowing PGE recovery of and a retur=
n on its investment in Trojan.=20

=09Enron cannot predict the outcome of these actions.  Although no assuranc=
es can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matte=
rs will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or res=
ults of operations.

Other Contingencies
=09Environmental Matters.  Enron is subject to extensive federal, state and=
 local environmental laws and regulations.  These laws and regulations requ=
ire expenditures in connection with the construction of new facilities, the=
 operation of existing facilities and for remediation at various operating =
sites.  The implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments is expected to r=
esult in increased operating expenses.  These increased operating expenses =
are not expected to have a material impact on Enron's financial position or=
 results of operations.

=09Enron's natural gas pipeline companies conduct soil and groundwater reme=
diation on a number of their facilities.  Enron does not expect to incur ma=
terial expenditures in connection with soil and groundwater remediation.

=09Developments in the California Power Market.  During 2000, prices for wh=
olesale electricity in California significantly increased as a result of a =
combination of factors, including higher natural gas prices, reduction in a=
vailable hydroelectric generation resources, increased demand, over-relianc=
e on the spot market for electricity and limitations on supply.  California=
's regulatory regime instituted in 1996 permitted wholesale price increases=
 but froze retail prices below market levels.  The resulting disparity betw=
een costs of supply and customer revenues caused two of California's public=
 utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E) and Southern California E=
dison Company (SCE), to accrue substantial unrecovered wholesale power cost=
s and certain obligations related to the difference between third party pow=
er purchase costs and frozen rates charged to retail customers.  PG&E and S=
CE have defaulted on or are challenging payments owed for certain outstandi=
ng obligations, including wholesale power purchased through the California =
Power Exchange (the Power Exchange), from the California Independent System=
 Operator (the Independent System Operator), and from qualifying facilities=
.  In addition, PG&E and the Power Exchange each have filed a voluntary pet=
ition for bankruptcy.

=09Various legislative, regulatory and legal remedies to the energy situati=
on in California have been implemented or are being pursued, and may result=
 in restructuring of markets in California and elsewhere.  Additional initi=
atives are likely at the Federal, state and local level, but it is not poss=
ible to predict their outcome at this time.

=09Enron has entered into a variety of transactions with California utiliti=
es, the Power Exchange, the Independent System Operator, end users of energ=
y in California, and other third parties, and is owed amounts by certain of=
 these entities.  Enron has established reserves related to such activities=
 and believes that the combination of such reserves in accounts receivables=
 and other credit offsets with such parties are adequate to cover its expos=
ure to developments in the California power market.  Due to the uncertainti=
es involved, the ultimate outcome of the California power situation cannot =
be predicted, but Enron believes these matters will not have a material adv=
erse impact on Enron's financial condition or results of operations.

=09India.  Enron indirectly owns 50% of the net voting interest in Dabhol P=
ower Company (Dabhol), which owns a 740 megawatt power plant and is constru=
cting an additional 1,444 megawatt power plant together with an LNG regasif=
ication facility (collectively Phase II) in India.  Enron accounts for its =
investment in Dabhol under the equity method and the debt of Dabhol is non-=
recourse to Enron.  Dabhol has been in dispute with the Maharashtra State E=
lectricity Board (MSEB), the purchaser of power from Dabhol, and the Govern=
ment of Maharashtra (GOM) and the federal government of India (GOI), the gu=
arantors of payments by the MSEB pursuant to the terms and conditions of th=
e power purchase agreements (PPA) and the other project documents.  The con=
tract disputes relate principally to (a) the failure by the MSEB to pay cer=
tain capacity and energy payments under the PPA, and the failure of the GOM=
 and GOI to satisfy certain guarantee obligations under the project documen=
ts and (b) MSEB's statements that MSEB has ""rescinded"" the PPA and MSEB is =
therefore no longer bound by the PPA.  As a result of such disputes, the Ph=
ase II lenders have stopped funding the continued construction of Phase II =
and the construction contractors have terminated the construction contracts=
 for non-payment.  There is no assurance that Dabhol will be able to resolv=
e such disputes to its favor and to successfully collect on and to enforce =
any judgment or settlement.  However, Dabhol believes that the MSEB's actio=
ns are in clear violation of the terms of the PPA, and Dabhol intends to pu=
rsue all available legal remedies under the project documents.  As a result=
 of these disputes, the 740 megawatt power plant is not being dispatched by=
 MSEB.  Further, Dabhol has suspended construction activity on Phase II.  E=
nron does not believe that any contract dispute related to Dabhol will have=
 a material adverse impact on Enron's financial condition or results of ope=
rations.",deleted items,10,2001,26

There will be a story in tomorrow's Financial Times about our trading position in Europe. Myself and John Sherriff spoke with London-based FT reporter Andy Taylor.

Andy is a long-standing contact and an Enron supporter. He spoke with various players in the European market and although they were supportive, they were also giving the impression that business with Enron had dropped 90%. 

This is not the case and it was therefore important to refute this. I'm comfortable with how the interview went. John made a point of saying how supportive counterparties had been and we did not discuss anything beyond our European trading position.

Will forward the coverage tomorrow.

Hope all is well and that you had an enjoyable Thanksgiving.

Cheers

Subject: Your Input please

Shona

Sent a message to Sally earlier this week that I realised afterwards would 
have been best directed to you in the first instance. Apologies for that.

I was and still am, seeking input on the whole issue of the level of written 
control procedures we should have and the best way to achieve that. When I 
first started here I was a little surprised at the lack of written 
procedures. While I believe the actual control structure is good, there is 
very little in writing, even in the most generic form. In discussing this 
with Paul Quilkey, he noted that policy, at least when he was in Houston, was 
to deliberately minimise the written procedures to prevent it being too 
transportable.

The reason for my query is that I last week looked at SCOR, a control review 
process marketed by the Aust Financial Markets Association. It is a risk 
control review process which allows you to benchmark your processes and which 
provide detailed documentation which can be personalised to your business, to 
create controls review. It is very detailed and has been subscribed to by 
most of our competitors in the energy market. 

I am interested in subscribing, it we want/need detailed review notes, 
however in light of PQ's comments I wanted your feed back on exactly what is 
required/desirable to have for each site. 

With thanks

Thank you all for participating on the associate and analyst PRC committee.  
I believe that the PRC process is the most important tool we have to evaluate 
Enron's talent, and your role in the process is critical.  With the all 
important year-end PRC quickly approaching, I'd like to spend a little time 
with you sharing not only my philosophy on the process, but also talking 
about the mechanics of the process.  There will also be time to answer any 
questions you may have.

To that end, please join me and Charlene Jackson for breakfast on Thursday, 
November 30, at 8:30 a.m. in EB50M.  If you are unable to attend in person 
and would like to participate by conference call, that can be arranged.  
Please RSVP your attendance to Cheryl Kuehl at x3-9804.

I look forward to seeing you on November 30, and again, many thanks for 
spending your time on this critical process.

On Friday, April 21, 2000, the NYMEX and equity markets will be closed.  As a 
result, there will not be a Daily Position Report issued for this date.  The 
London office will be closed on Friday, April 21 and the following Monday, 
April 24.   Due to the fact that most risk groups are not planning on being 
in the office on Friday, the DPR for Thursday's business will be prepared and 
issued on Monday, April 24.

We have a 90,000 MMBtu/d first of the month nomination against our term
baseload contract and a 20,000 MMBtu/d spot swing contract for January. I
assume that the 105,000 MMBtu/d demand request would be allocated 90,000
MMBtu/d against the baseload contract and 15,000 MMBtu/d against the spot
swing contract.

Most of the assets on this list are currently being monitored by Special Assets or Energy Capital Resources.  We included these assets on the list because they have not been very visible and we wanted to make sure that you were aware of their existence.  However, also included on the list are 3 to 4 transactions similar to Midwest Gas Storage in that it appears that they have not been on anyone's radar screen.  The scope of our review did not include any former Enron International assets now managed by Wholesale through the Global Assets group.

Our list is divided into 3 parts:  1) Retained assets, 2) Bankruptcy/ Guarantor Claims,  3) Transactions requiring legal documentation/ closure.  The Bankruptcy/Guarantor list is not an all inclusive list of bankruptcies for Wholesale but includes those merchant portfolio bankruptcies with a  low probability of recovery which are, of course, not a high priority for Legal.  We just want to make sure they don't completely disappear from our scrutiny.  You will also note that there are a couple of assets that require further review and we will advise you when we make a final determination.

Finally, we will take steps to include these assets in future portfolio reporting so that they can be closely monitored.

Many thanks to Dick Lydecker's group and Legal for their assistance to RAC in reviewing numerous disposed assets that resulted in this list.   Please call if you have questions.    Regards!     Rick C.

I spoke to Mark and he outlined 2 potential fixes to the spread dilemma.  We can leave it the way it is (with some clarifying changes to the descriptions) or we can ask either the gas or the power desk to completely change their products.  Neither one is a very elegant solution.  Jay and I are scheduling meetings with each of the desks over the next few weeks, and I would like to take that opportunity to diligence the issue in person with the traders.  In short, we're working on it.

We have some inconsistency in the way we are doing spreads it was OK when it was US and UK but now we are doing it different ways here.   Andy will tell you that this was sort of forseen.  We do need to sort out something - maybe more in the short description which helps to indentify what you are buying and what you are selling.

Subject: January 11 - Managing Operational Risk

Please join me on Thursday, January 11 from 1:00 to 4:00 pm for a special 
information session for the Operations Management teams supporting Enron 
Americas, Enron Global Markets and Enron Industrial Markets.   We will focus 
on assessing, managing and mitigating operational risk.  Details on the 
location for the meeting will be sent to you early next week.  

I look forward to seeing everyone at this meeting on the 11th.  The things 
that we will discuss will be important for each and every one of you as you 
carry out your roles in 2001.  I hope that you will make every effort to 
attend.  Please let me know as soon as possible if you have a conflict that 
will keep you from attending the meeting.

to your starting on the 29th.  Certainly if anything comes up with the move 
or the family, feel free to shift that date as needed.  I will be glad to 
have you as part of the team and think that we will have fun working 
together.  

I am on vacation next week (lots of shopping, wrapping, baking planned, plus 
Tyler's birthday party), and I am really looking forward to that.  I do feel 
as if I have been the PRC queen recently.  Wes' PRC last Thursday, mine on 
Friday, Enron Wholesale Services (minus Europe) with Mark Frevert on Monday 
of this week and a full day (7:30 am to 8:00 pm on Wednesday for the 
Associates PRC.  I do need a break!  

I will be working the week after Christmas.  Although we do have a holiday on 
December 26th, we will trading that day.  Lots of my logistics and risk guys 
will be in, so I will probably make an appearance that day.  I will be in for 
full days on the 27th -29th.  Very few commitments on the calendar for those 
days, so just let me know when you would like to get together.  

Hope that you, Frank and Lauren have a wonderful Christmas holiday.  --Sally

Subject: Catch up

Hi there  -- As I recall you are off next week, so wanted to touch base.  I 
am sure you will be ready  -- after PRC's and the craziness that has been 
going on over there.  

Just wanted to confirm my availability   and maybe see if we should get 
together while I am in Houston  (will be there between Christmas and New 
Year's) and could come in for a few hours or meet you for lunch.  

I think you said that you will be in London in early January - is that still 
happening?  Alternatively we could get together then.

Also -- I am planning to be ready to start work with you on Jan 29th  
(hopefully I can get Lauren into her school the week before - so she can get 
used to it).   We are leaving London on the 20th (AA signs of on our year end 
earnings release on Friday the 19th)  and then I will have a week to sort 
things out at home before starting!



I am really looking forward to learning something new, and working with you.  
Thanks for the opportunity.



If we don't speak before the holidays, I hope your family has a wonderful 
Christmas. 


Beth

Nagesh, 

Please resort the pipeline order on the Texas/HPLC position screen in CPR.  
The current sort makes it difficult for us to manage our trading position 
each day.  The arrangement  (from the top of the screen to the bottom) that 
would most benefit us is listed below:

Houston Pipe Line
East Texas Gas System
NNGB
Oasis
PG&E Valero
All remaining pipes listed in alphabetical order by pipe name.


Please look into this and let me know of any problems in making these changes.

Thanks.

I have no problem sticking around with the group, it is a compliment and I am glad that you all appreciate what I have been able to contribute to the group.  I just want your opinion on something.

One of my many goals while a part of the analyst program is to become a  senior analyst or third year analyst.  It is a promotion that also brings with it a bit of a pay increase.  In no way do I want to imply greed, or that I will only stay for money, but if in your opinion I may be deserving of this, then maybe we could run it by Bob or the program, or whoever is in control of that.

Subject: Organizational Changes

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=

to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=

Attached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale=20
Services which summarizes the changes described here.  As this organization=

continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

Do the innocuouss route and send them a letter stating you will change it at the next available/scheduled GTC change would be my suggestion.

Also just to confirm no GTC  changes on anything for the near future.

Thanks

Subject: RE: GTC Change for removal of HPL language


Savita,

 As we have discussed, when Enron sold HPL to AEP, Enron specifically agreed that all rights to the name ""Houston Pipe Line Company"" as of June 1,2001, were the sole property of AEP/HPL and that no Enron Entity would use that name.
 On or about the first of June, the EOL Long Product descriptions were modified to provide that notwithstanding that the GTC's for physical natural gas provided that all Enron transactions in Texas were to be deemed HPL transactions, that such language was overridden by the Long Product description.
Notwithstanding this modification to the Long Product description, AEP is claiming that the continued use by EOL in EOL's GTC's violates the Purchase and Sale Agreement and impinges on its trademark ""HPL"".  As we discussed last week, we have  received a letter from AEP threatening a lawsuit if we do not immediately remove the references to HPL from the EOL GTC's.

Based on what has been happening in the past several days, I completely concur that we should not require that any EOL Counterparty ""re-accept"" the physical natural gas GTC's in order to trade with ENRON.

I advise that we either (i) do nothing and risk being sued by AEP, or (ii) that we forget about making any other ""cleanup"" changes requested by Stacy and merely notify the applicable Counterparties that as evidenced by the Long Product description for physical natural gas transactions, all such transactions will continue to be with Enron, not HPL, and that the EOL GTC will be modified as of [date] to eliminate any reference to HPL.

I would suggest that this notification be done as innocuously as possible....such as on the remittance statements in/on our checks to these Counterparties or on our invoices.  We should not ask any Counterparty to sign or return anything to reflect this, nor should we request any reacceptance of out EOL GTC .

You have inquired as to the possibility of getting AEP to enter into an agreement with Enron to not change our online GTC at this time.  Frankly, at the present time the relationship between Enron and AEP is quite antagonistic..... we have several matters pending which need to be resolved.......in order to reach some type of agreement with them regarding use of the HPL name we would need to ""make it worth their while""..... and due to some of the positions Enron is currently taking, AEP would probably refuse to enter into any such side agreement with or without costly concessions . 

Thus, as I stated earlier, we should either ""do nothing"" and wait for the lawsuit....or go the ""innocuous notice"" route.

I have spoken with Mark Taylor and he concurs that under the current circumstances, these are preferable routes to the POP-Up and reacceptance  route which had been in the works for the past few months.

Please fell free to call me with any questions or comments.  If we decide to go the ""notification route"", I will promptly draft the exact language to be used.

Best Regards
Barbara

Hi Mark, Barbara,

Can we work something out with AEP whereby we don't change the online GTC for sometime? We do have language in the Product Long Description that adresses the sale of HPL. Is there any other way we can allay AEP's concern that counterparties logging onto EnronOnline are confused about the actual ownership of HPL. Thanks.

2000 Plan.  However, please note that their are some problems/clean-up that 
needs to occur that I could not do.

As you requested, I have taken the % we allocated to Gas Assets last year and 
put the appropriate %'s into the appropriate group within Gas Assets as you 
have broken them out.  Please note:  Gas Network Trading is the same group as 
ST GasTexas (group 8) - Tom Martin is responsible for both.  I have indicated 
the appropriate %'s into the NEW buckets, but I was not able to ZERO out the 
ST GasTexas group as the cells are protected.  Consequently, the TOTAL column 
indicates that I have allocated over 100%.  The #'s in Gas Network Trading 
are correct.  Will you please delete ST GasTexas so that no one will allocate 
to it?
When the plan allocations were submitted last year, there was an error in 
RC1160 - Volume Management.  I thought we corrected it but it is still 
showing up incorrectly.  Please move the 8% under East Origin to ST GasEast.  
I was not able to correct this either as the cells have been protected.  
Please note:  This is not a change from the plan, but a correction of an 
error. 

I would appreciate you correcting these things for me, and forwarding the 
corrected version back to me for my records.  I will be working with our 
management team on the 1/00 allocations, and will provide you those by 
Friday.  Please call me if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Enron cuts shareholder equity by 1.2 bln usd due to partnership deal

10/18/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd
LONDON (AFX) - Enron Corp said it has reduced its shareholder equity by 1.2 bln usd as the company decided to repurchase 55 mln of its shares that it had issued as part of a series of complex transactions with an investment vehicle connected to its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition. 
Enron did not disclose the big equity reduction in its earnings release issued on Tuesday, when the Houston-based energy giant announced a 1.01 bln usd charge to third-quarter earnings that produced a 618 mln usd loss.
However, the company briefly mentioned it in a subsequent call with security analysts and confirmed it in response to questions yesterday. As a result of the reduction, Enron's shareholder equity dropped to 9.5 bln usd, the company said. 
In an interview, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay said about 35 mln usd of the 1.01 bln usd charge to earnings was related to transactions with LJM2 Co-Investment LP, a limited partnership created and run by Fastow. 
In a conference call yesterday with investors, Lay said 55 mln shares had been repurchased by Enron, as the company ""unwound"" its participation in the transactions. In the third quarter, the company's average number of shares outstanding was 913 mln. 
According to Rick Causey, Enron's chief accounting officer, these shares were contributed to a ""structured finance vehicle"" set up about two years ago in which Enron and LJM2 were the only investors. In exchange for the stock, the entity provided Enron with a note. 
The aim of the transaction was to provide hedges against fluctuating values in some of Enron's broadband telecommunications and other technology investments. Causey did not elaborate on what form those hedges took. 
Subsequently, both the value of Enron's stock and the value of the broadband investments hedged by the entity dropped sharply, the report said. As a result, Enron decided essentially to dissolve the financing vehicle and reacquire the shares. When Enron reacquired the shares, it also canceled the note it had received from the entity. 
Given all the complexities of the LJM-related financing vehicle and the questions it raised outside the company, ""the confusion factor wasn't worth the trouble of trying to continue this,"" Causey said. 
Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, described the capital reduction ""as just a balance-sheet issue"" and therefore was not deemed ""material"" for disclosure purposes.

Calif Energy Panel OKs First Step For 1160MW In Projects

10/18/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California Energy Commission has accepted as ""data adequate"" applications to build a 900-megawatt power plant and two peaker plants totaling 260 megawatts, a press release said. 
The data adequacy vote means an application has been accepted as having sufficient information to proceed with the commission's approval process.
Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Roseville Energy Facility LLC unit has proposed building a 900-MW natural gas-fired plant in Sacramento, Calif., to be online by the fourth quarter of 2004. The construction cost will be $350-$450 million for the combined-cycle project, which will undergo a 12-month review process by the commission. 
GWF Energy LLC has applied to build the 169-MW Tracy Peaker Project, a simple cycle plant in the San Joaquin Valley, Calif., that would be online by July 2002. Peaker plants operate during times of high electricity demand. 
The company also applied to build the 91-MW Henrietta Peaker Project, 20 miles south of Hanford, Calif., which would consist of two turbine generators and come on line by June 2002. 
Electricity generated from the two peaker projects will be sold to the state's Department of Water Resources under a 10-year contract.

USA: Enron's stock slides as equity reduction digested.

10/18/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
HOUSTON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. stock fell sharply on Thursday as investors digested news of a $1.2 billion reduction in the energy giant's shareholder equity that attracted little attention when it was first disclosed earlier this week. 
In afternoon trading Enron's stock was off $2.96 or, 9.2 percent at $29.24 per share.
Enron reported its first quarterly loss in over four years on Tuesday after taking charges of $1.01 billion against earnings to cover expenses and writedowns on investments that fall outside its core wholesale energy operations. 
The reduction in shareholder equity was not mentioned in the company's earnings statement but was discussed by Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay in an earnings conference call with analysts and investors on Tuesday. 
""Confidence has been shaken by the incremental disclosure. This is an extremely widely held stock and to assume that everybody listened to the conference call is probably asking too much,"" said one analyst who asked not to be identified. 
The reduction in equity was prominently reported in the Wall Street journal on Thursday, bringing it to the attention of a wider audience, analysts said. 
Lay said the equity writedown and a corresponding reduction in the number of Enron shares outstanding were related to the early termination of structured finance arrangements which had drawn criticism from some Wall Street analysts. 
As a result of the operation, Enron's debt to total capitalization ratio will rise to about 50 percent, but the company expects the proceeds of asset sales to reduce the ratio to around 40 percent by the end of next year, Lay said. 
Moody's Investor Service said earlier this week that it had placed all of Enron's long-term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade because writedowns and charges had substantially reduced valuations for several Enron businesses. 
Some of Enron's financing arrangements require the company to maintain investment grade credit ratings.

Brazil's Copene, Elektro Plan to Sell 820 Mln Reais of Bonds
2001-10-18 13:53 (New York)


     Rio de Janeiro, Oct. 18 (Bloomberg) -- Two Brazilian
companies have asked securities regulators for permission to sell
820 million reais ($279 million) of bonds, raising the amount of
pending local market bond sales to 7.5 billion reais.

     Brazil's Copene-Petroquemica do Nordeste SA, a Petrochemical
company, has asked Brazil's government for permission to sell 625
million reais of bonds according to the country's security and
exchange regulator, the CVM. Banco Citibank SA, the Brazilian unit
of Citigroup Inc., will manage the sale.

     Elektro Eletricidade e Servicos SA, an electricity utility
controlled by U.S.-based Enron Corp. that distributes electricity
in Sao Paulo state, has asked for permission to sell 195 million
reais of bonds, according to a CVM filing.

     No further details about the sales was immediately available.
     Brazilian companies have scrambled to sell debt at home as
the local currency, the real, plunges against the dollar, making
dollar-denominated debt expensive and causing losses to mount as
the local currency value of dollar debts soars.

     So far this year, about 9.1 billion reais of local market
debt has been sold. Meanwhile corporate bond sales in euros or
dollars has slipped by almost two thirds to $1.7 billion in the
third quarter from $4.5 billion in the second, not including sales
through offshore subsidiaries, according to Bloomberg data.",sec media,10,2001,18

concerns raised in the e-mail below.? Richard's main concerns were as follows:

1.? As to filing of a claim for equity interests held, Richard indicates that 
this is not common practice and there may not be any provision for it in Thai 
bankruptcy law.? The claims to be filed are ""applications for debt 
repayment"", which are intended to set forth a fixed sum of which the creditor 
seeks payment.? Given the nature of equity investments, they do not really 
fit into the governing Thai bankruptcy law provisions.? Richard is following 
up with his Thai partner to further explore this issue, and I will be 
speaking with both of them later today.

2.? As to the contingent indemnification claims, Richard advises that the 
""application for debt repayment"" must state a claim in a fixed amount.? 
Again, he is going to consult with his Thai partner on this issue, but his 
suggested approach is to file the claims as follows:? (1) with respect to the 
pending litigation, in the face amount of the claims asserted against the 
defendants (as an approximation of the potential maximum exposure); and (2) 
with respect to any potential litigation, in the total face amount of the 
bond issuances (also as an approximation of potential maximum exposure).? Two 
areas of greater uncertainty are any claims for legal fees and/or punitive 
damages, which obviously are not readily quantifiable.

I will keep you advised of our further discussions on these issues.?

Subject: NSM - Claim Filing 

We write further to our telephone discussion with Deb Korkmas this evening 
(our time) in relation to the above matter. 

As discussed during the course of our telephone discussion, there are a 
number of outstanding issues that, bearing in mind the 12 hour time 
difference between Bangkok and you and the deadline of the claim submission 
which is on Monday 7 August, we would require them to be settled by Friday. 

1.????? Claim amounts 
We note from the documentation so far received by us and your e-mail 
yesterday that the following entities will claim under the following 
agreements: 

1.1???? Enron North America Corp. wishes to claim for the principal amount 
outstanding and the interest outstanding for the Notes under the Security 
Purchase Agreement, Indenture and Guarantee.? We would appreciate it if this 
could be confirmed and also the definite amount of principal and interest 
that is to be claimed. 

1.2???? Enron North America Corp. wishes to claim for the shares (equity), 
as listed in the Shareholders Agreement, held by it in NSM.? However, having 
reviewed the documentation so far received by us we are unsure as to the 
legal grounds under which Enron North America Corp is entitled to claim this 
sum.? Could you please clarify the nature of this claim. 

1.3???? ECT Thailand Investment Inc. wishes to claim for the shares 
(equity), as listed in the Securities Purchase Agreement, held by it in NSM. 
However, as in 1.2 above, having reviewed the documentation received by us 
we are unsure as to the legal grounds under which ECT Thailand Investment 
Inc is entitled to claim this sum.? Could you please clarify the nature of 
this claim. 

1.4???? ECT Securities Limited Partnership wishes to claim for any 
contingent liability that they may be subject to as a result of the 
litigation undertaken by Farallon Capital, et al. and Legg Mason Income 
Trust, Inc., et al.? As discussed, the sums which are allowed to be claimed 
have to be fixed sums as of the date on which the court granted an order to 
reorganise NSM's business, i.e. 8 May 2000.? It would appear to us that, 
asides from the legal fee sums, an exact sum for the contingent liabilities 
cannot be ascertained at this time. I would, therefore, appreciate 
clarification of how this is to be determined, otherwise the claim amount 
may have to be the full potential liabilities as claimed in the two 
litigation cases. 

2.????? Documentation 
As discussed, we also require the following documentation which we 
understand will be faxed to us during the course of today. 

2.1???? Corporate documents of the 3 entities making claims 
2.2???? Evidence of the change in the entities name if different from the 
name in the relevant agreements 
2.2???? Debenture Certificate (either global or definitive) 
2.3???? Evidence of the payment purchase price 
2.4???? A copy of the Notice of the Event of Default or demand letters as 
sent by the Trustee (if any) 
2.5???? The ""Definition and Rules of Usage"" as defined in the Shareholders 
Agreement (in addition, we do not know whether your claims in relation to 
the Shareholders Agreement are related to certain documents as described 
therein, e.g. Management Agreement, Enron Purchase Agreement, if they are 
related, we would require copies of such agreements as well) 
2.6???? Tables setting out all amounts (i.e. principal, interest, expenses, 
etc.) being claimed by the 3 claiming entities 

As mentioned in our discussion, in order to complete the application on time 
we would really need to have everything in place by Friday, given the 
deadline of the claim submission is on Monday, 7 August.? We would, 
therefore, appreciate it if you could reply to all of the above outstanding 
issues by today (your time) so that if there are any further outstanding 
issues we can try and clarify these during the course of tomorrow (our time) 
and perhaps during the weekend.? You may either respond to this email or 
alternatively call my mobile phone (661) 619 1262 or Richard Smith's mobile 
phone (661) 611 1184.

I am not quite there I am afraid. Are you saying that the folks outside NY 
and London have no autonomy and are merely acting on trading instructions 
issued by the London or NY trading desks ? If that is the case:

Why don't NY and London do the deals themselves and let the locals 
concentrate on generating business ?
There should be no ""Chicago Book"" (SCRP) for example
That conflicts with the ""envelope"" which you mention, which appears to be a 
delegated trading authority, in which case we are back to ""square one"" it 
would appear.

Help me out.

The set-up for the financial trading is similiar except that the instructions 
are relaid by e-mail each night to New York and Tokyo.  Tim Pateman 
(authorised trader in London) sends details of positions and instructions on 
prices / volumes. 

The mail provide directions on pricing (off set basis on EOL) and volumes, 
creating an envelope in which they can trade.
They  must call for further instructions if the price shifts by more than $10 
($100 for Tin & Nickel)  or the position by more than 100 lots.

David,

The business model you outline is actually the one we are implementing with 
one big difference - the Head Trader in London (Sam Hainsworth) calls the 
sales person each day to tell him what to do before they speak to any 
customers. As you point out, these conversations are recorded so if the sales 
person does anything other than what is agreed at the outset of each day, 
then they will be red carded.

I refer you back to the memo supplementing the updated list of authorised 
traders that I sent out and which Marcelo and Sam have discussed with 
Commercial staff in both these offices (Shona and Bjorn have this memo), as 
well as Marcelo's operational plan.

Clarification point - when Andy says ""internally"" he means that Commercial 
(Rob Soeldner) is taking a lead in resolving Joe Robertson's concerns.

Regards,
Tim

How about this for a business model for an origination and trading outfit.

salesperson talks to customer
customer agrees to trade
salesperson phones trading desk and gets price (trading desk is London or NY 
- NB: all lines are taped) 
salesperson tell customer
customers says ok
salesperson says ""done"" to customer and trading desk
trading desk books deal, middle and back office processes kicks in, sends out 
and chases up confirm etc
accounting process identifies value added by salesperson and gives them a 
piece of the price as a credit
no bank accounts or signing authority in sales office 
no accountants, middle office people or other similar humans in the sales 
office, just sales people
all hedging and risk taking resident in trading books in NY or London

Can we not make this work ?

Bjorn

As discussed, given Joe's comments below, a note to confirm that this being 
dealt with internally. 

Rob Soeldner has made it clear to Joe that:

Enron places great importance on trading controls. These are non-negotiatable.
The suggested course of action is not an option 
We aren't seeking to close any of the Agency offices given implemetation of 
these controls.

Joe is not in yet - Rob will be discussing with him further when the US gets 
in.

Of note - Joe is on the commercial side,  Marcelo Parra who is responsible 
for the operational side is fully onboard for the operational changes made.

Andy

As a practical matter the procedures outlined are not workable. We need to 
find a way to go forward that works and can satisfy all concerned. 

Either the people in these offices can be entrusted to transact and execute 
business or we should consider closing these offices and relocating some of 
the people which I do not believe makes any sense at all.

VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF 21

 Plaintiff hereby alleges on information and belief based upon the
investigation made by and through her attorneys, as follows:
 I.
 NATURE OF THE CASE

1. This is a class action seeking redress under the law of California
for defendants' conduct in the market for wholesale electricity.  During the
spring and summer of 2000, a group of electricity generators and traders,
including defendants, exercising market power, unlawfully manipulated the
California wholesale electricity market, resulting in grossly inflated
wholesale electricity prices throughout the state and much of the Western
United States. Defendants accomplished this result by, inter alia,
improperly using confidential real time generator capacity, use, and
maintenance data, and transmission system flow data to ""game"" the wholesale
electricity market, by withholding electrical generating capacity from the
California Power Exchange's forward markets, by improperly parking power
with affiliates in other states which was later resold in California at
inflated rates, by scheduling previously unplanned plant outages to coincide
with other plants' planned maintenance shutdowns, and by scheduling
transmission flows to cause or exacerbate congestion.
2. The improper use of confidential real time data was in violation of
the California Tariff by which  defendants are authorized to sell wholesale
electricity within California.
3. By engaging in said unfair business practices, defendants have
directly and severely damaged purchasers of electricity supplied through the
California Power Exchange.  As noted in the August 30, 2000 San Diego Union
Tribune:  ""The utility bills of all [electric] ratepayers in San Diego are
exorbitant. . . . Rates that were 3 cents per kilowatt hour have risen to 19
cents per kilowatt hour in just three months -- nothing short of
confiscatory rates.""
 4. In its November 1, 2000 Order, the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (""FERC"") expressly found that electricity prices in California
have been maintained at ""unjust and unreasonable"" levels during the relevant
period, though it determined that it did not have the authority to mandate
refunds or other retroactive relief with respect thereto.  In its November
22, 2000 response to the November 1st FERC order, the California Public
Utilities Commission (CPUC) concluded that due to market manipulation by
wholesale energy producers and traders, customers of electricity supplied
through the California Power Exchange had been overcharged more than $4
billion dollars during the summer of 2000.  In its November 22nd response to
the November 1st FERC order, even the California Independent System Operator
(CAISO) which manages California's transmission system infrastructure, known
as the ""power grid"", found that the summer 2000 prices resulted from the
exercise of intolerable levels of market power by generators and traders.
 II.
 VENUE

5. Venue is proper because defendants each transact business in the
State of California and because the damages caused by defendants' unlawful
manipulation of the price of wholesale electricity occurred in San Diego
County.
III.
 PARTIES

6. Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is an adult resident living in San Diego,
California.  Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is a retail electricity customer of
SDG&E, and has been forced to pay rates for electricity during the Class
Period (defined infra) that are unjust and unfair and that have been
artificially inflated by defendants' misconduct.  Moreover, plaintiff Pamela
R. Gordon was born with no lymph nodes in her legs which results in a lack
of circulation.  Exposure to high temperatures will cause plaintiff Pamela
R. Gordon's legs to swell, which can lead to possible severe health
consequences.  As a result of her condition, plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon must
maintain her home at temperatures of not more than 67 degrees at night and
71 degrees during the day.  Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is unable to
terminate her electricity service and has been forced to pay unjust and
unfair rates for electricity from SDG&E as a result of defendants'
misconduct.  Specifically, plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon was charged and/or
paid the following rates for electricity by SDG&E during the Class Period:

 15. Defendants DOES 1 through 100, inclusive, are sued herein under
fictitious names because their true names are unknown to the Plaintiff.
When their true names and capacities are ascertained, Plaintiff will amend
this complaint by substituting their true names and capacities herein.
Plaintiff is informed and believe, and based thereon alleges, that each of
the fictitiously named Defendants is responsible in some manner for the
occurrences herein alleged, and thereby proximately caused injuries and
damages to Plaintiff, as herein alleged.  Further, Plaintiff is informed and
believes, and upon such information and belief alleges, that each of the
Defendants designated by a fictitious name participated in and/or benefited
from the wrongful acts, conduct, and omissions described in this complaint,
and that said acts, conduct, and omissions directly and proximately caused
injury and damages to Plaintiff and the class as alleged below.
 IV.
 CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS

16. Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Section 382 of the Code of
Civil Procedure as a class action on behalf of all electricity customers,
including the retail customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E),
who purchased electricity supplied through the California Power Exchange
during the period from May 22, 2000 through and including the date of trial
(hereinafter the ""Class Period"").  All such persons and entities have paid
and/or have been charged prices for electricity that were ""unjust and
unreasonable"" and that were artificially inflated due to defendants'
exercise of market power, improper use of confidential information,
manipulations, and unlawful actions.  Members of the Class are extremely
numerous and their joinder would be impracticable.  Approximately 1.2
million SDG&E customers are within the class.
17. Common issues of fact and law predominate over individual issues,
including:
-whether defendants committed unfair business practices by sharing
confidential real time data in violation of ISO Tariffs and thereafter
""gamed"" the market;

-whether defendants charged ""unjust and unreasonable"" prices for electricity
during the Class Period or otherwise benefited from said inflated price for
electricity;

-whether defendants exercised ""market power"" in the California electricity
market during the Class Period;

-whether defendants received improper and excess profits which should be
refunded and paid to members of the Class.

18. Plaintiff's interests are typical of, and not antagonistic to, the
interests of the class.
19. Plaintiff has retained competent counsel experienced in class action
and consumer fraud litigation and intends to vigorously prosecute this
action.
20. A class action is superior to all other methods for the fair and
efficient adjudication of this controversy.  The size of the individual
damages is small in comparison to the complexity and scope of the
defendants' operations and alleged misconduct.  A class action is the only
method whereby plaintiff and the class can efficiently seek redress and
obtain a uniform adjudication of their claims. Plaintiff does not anticipate
any difficulty with the management of this action.

  V.
 COMMON ALLEGATIONS OF FACT

A. The California Wholesale Electricity Markets

21. In 1996 California deregulated its electricity industry and required
the State's privately owned utility companies to divest themselves of their
generating plants.  The purpose of deregulation was to introduce competition
into the electricity markets, with the intention of reducing rates for
electrical power.  In fact, however, certain participants in this recently
deregulated industry have, in violation of their operating Tariff, taken
advantage of structural flaws in the system and improperly obtained
confidential competitor information to artificially inflate prices for
electricity, yielding themselves billions of dollars in windfall profits at
the expense of California consumers.
22. As part of the deregulation, several new entities were created to
facilitate the workings of this new market.  California's investor owned
utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), Southern California Edison (SCE),
and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) (the""Utilities""), now purchase
electricity for their customers from independent generators and traders,
including defendants, through a market known as the California Power
Exchange (PX).  The PX maintains a market for the purchase and sale of
wholesale electricity through a variety of forward contracts and real time
markets.  Under the California deregulatory scheme, the Utilities were,
until just recently, required to purchase power through the PX and
prohibited from independently contracting for power outside this market.
23. The deregulated market also led to the creation of the California
Independent System Operator (CAISO).  The CAISO is an ""independent""
non-profit corporation, though its managing board includes representatives
from among the generators and traders, that was created to manage the flow
of electricity and ensure reliability along the long distance, high-voltage
power lines that make up the bulk of California's transmission system.
Approximately 75% of California's electricity is distributed through the
CAISO managed  ""power grid"".  The CAISO monitors electrical loads (i.e.,
demand) on an on-going basis and ensures that there is an adequate supply of
power to meet that demand.
/ / /
 24. The CAISO accomplishes this by maintaining a Real Time Imbalance
Market (the ""Real Time Market"").  When the CAISO receives bids from
suppliers that are insufficient to meet the demand for power, it must accept
any bid, which then sets the market-clearing price for that hour. Under the
single price auction system used by the CAISO, all sellers of electricity in
the Real Time Market automatically receive the market clearing price, which
is the (second) highest price paid in the market, even if they were willing
to sell and had in fact bid to sell electricity at lower prices. This
mechanism allows sophisticated market participants, such as defendants, to
game the market by withholding bids in an effort to maximize the clearing
price.
25. The Real Time Market was not designed to handle large transactions,
but merely to provide a mechanism to correct short term imbalances in supply
and demand.  Defendants nonetheless pushed a substantial portion of the
daily wholesale electricity sales into this market by under bidding capacity
to the forward market leaving wholesale customers no alternative place to
obtain the power to satisfy their retail customers' demand.
26. The CAISO also manages the Replacement Reserve Market, which is used
to balance supply and demand of electricity.  Sellers in the Replacement
Reserve Market receive a fixed premium for having available capacity.  If
called upon by the ISO to deliver energy, sellers in the Replacement Reserve
Market also receive the Real Time Market price.  Thus, if generators know
that capacity is short, they have an incentive to withhold supplies from the
spot markets and push as much as possible into the Replacement Reserve
Market.  Access to real time generating information facilitates such
""gaming"" of the markets by demonstrating, in real time, available competing
supply.
27. In times of high demand, the CAISO has the authority to purchase
energy from out-of-state sources, as to which there is no operative price
cap.  The CAISO was forced to do so during the Summer of 2000.  California
generators and marketers can export electricity to surrounding markets in
order to create artificial shortages and drive up prices in the California
markets.  They can then resell that electricity to the CAISO at inflated and
uncapped prices.  As the PX Compliance Committee noted in its November 1,
2000 Report (""the PX Compliance Report""):
/ / /
 ""During periods of high Out-of-Market purchases, when prices are above the
Real-Time energy price cap, in-state generators have an incentive to export
energy out of California.  Surrounding control areas can effectively park
that energy for resale to the CAISO Out-of-Market calls and return it to the
state.""

Id. at p. 44.
28. Notably, the summer of 2000 witnessed an approximately 370% increase
in exports from  the California energy market, despite the very high prices
and short supplies that existed in the State.
  ""Market power"" is defined by the CAISO as the ability to
significantly influence market prices and cause them to vary from
competitive levels for a material period of time.  Generators and suppliers
(including defendants) can exercise market power by physically or
economically withholding electricity from the market, moving electricity out
of the California markets, and by pricing and bidding their resources in
ways that impede the efficiency of the market.

29. Notably, the California energy market consists of a relatively small
number of firms, some of which control a substantial fraction of the total
generating capacity.  The small number of suppliers facilitates the exercise
of  market power during periods of high demand, even when there is not a
true scarcity of available generating capacity.  In addition, the relatively
inelastic demand for energy further facilitates the exercise of such market
power.
B. Defendants' Improper Acts
30. Prior to May 22, 2000, the CAISO began supplying the Western Systems
Coordinating Council (""WSCC""), an organization consisting of electric
industry participants, including defendants, with real time industry data as
to electricity generating levels, known as metering data, and transmission
system flow data, known as scheduling data, pertaining to individual market
participants. Through the WSCC Internet web site, wholesale electricity
market participants, including defendants herein, were thereby given access
to real time data as to their competitors' actions, although access to such
data was forbidden by the ISO Tariff.  When requested by various
governmental entities, including the California Public Utilities Commission
(""CPUC"") the WSCC refused access.
/ / /
/ / /
/ / /
 31. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 10.2.6 states in relevant part;
Meter Data supplied by an ISO  metered entity shall be made available by the
ISO to the scheduling coordinator representing such ISO metered entity and
other authorized users identified in its meter services agreement, but shall
not be disclosed to any third party except as otherwise may be required by
law, FERC any local regulatory authority or other provision of this ISO
Tariff.

32. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.1 states in relevant part:

The ISO shall maintain the confidentiality of all of the documents, data and
information provided to it by any Market Participant that are treated as
confidential or commercially sensitive under Section 20.3.2; provided,
however, that the ISO need not keep confidential: (1) information that is
explicitly subject to data exchange through WEnet pursuant to Section 6 of
this ISO Tariff; (2) information that the ISO or the Market Participant
providing the information is required to disclose pursuant to this ISO
Tariff, or applicable regulatory requirements (provided that the ISO shall
comply with any applicable limits on such disclosure); or (3) information
that becomes available to the public on a non-confidential basis (other than
as a result of the ISO's breach of this ISO Tariff).

33. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part:

The following information provided to the ISO by Scheduling Coordinators
shall be treated by the ISO as confidential:

(a) individual bids for Supplemental Energy;

(b) individual Adjustment Bids for Congestion Management which are not
designated by the scheduling coordinator as available;

(c) individual bids for Ancillary Services;

(d) transactions between Scheduling Coordinators;

(e) individual Generator Outage programs unless a Generator makes a
change to its Generator Outage program which causes Congestion in the short
term (i.e. one month or less), in which case, the ISO may publish the name
of that Generator.

34. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part:

No Market Participant shall have the right hereunder to receive from the ISO
or to review any documents, data or other information of another Market
Participant to the extent such documents, data or information is to be
treated as in accordance with Section 20.3.2; provided, however, a market
Participant may receive and review any composite documents, data, and other
information that may be developed based upon such confidential documents,
data, or information, if the composite document does not disclose such
confidential data or information relating to an individual Market
Participant and provided, however, that the ISO may disclose information as
provided for in its bylaws.

 35. Part of the CAISO Tariff is the ISO Market Monitoring & Information
Protocol (MMIP).  The objective of this Protocol (MMIP) is to set forth the
workplan and rules under which the ISO will monitor the ISO markets to
identify abuses of market power.  The MMIP part of the tariff applies to all
ISO Market Participants, including Defendants.
36. MMIP Section 2.1.1. states in relevant part:
Anomalous market behavior, which is defined as behavior that departs
significantly from the normal behavior in competitive markets that do not
require continuing regulation or as behavior leading to unusual or
unexplained market outcomes.  Evidence of such behavior may be derived from
a number of circumstances, including:

MMIP 2.1.1.1  withholding of generation capacity under circumstances in
which it would normally be offered in a competitive market;

MMIP 2.1.1.2  unexplained or unusual redeclarations of availability by
Generators;

MMIP 2.1.1.3  unusual trades or transactions;

MMIP 2.1.1.4  pricing and bidding patterns that are inconsistent with
prevailing supply and demand conditions, e.g., prices and bids that appear
consistently excessive for or otherwise inconsistent with such conditions;
and

MMIP 2.1.1.5  unusual activity or circumstances relating to imports from or
exports to other markets or exchanges.

The Market Surveillance Unit shall evaluate, on an ongoing basis, whether
the continued or persistent presence of such circumstances indicates the
presence of behavior that is designed to or has the potential to distort the
operation and efficient functioning of a competitive market, e.g., the
strategic withholding and redeclaring of capacity, and whether it indicates
the presence and exercise of market power or of other unacceptable
practices.

37. MMIP Section 2.1.3 states in relevant part:

""Gaming"", or taking unfair advantage of the rules and procedures set forth
in the PX or ISO Tariffs, Protocols or Activity Rules, or of transmission
constraints in periods in which exist substantial Congestion, to the
detriment of the efficiency of, and of consumers in, the ISO Markets.
""Gaming"" may also include taking undue advantage of other conditions that
may affect the availability of transmission and generation capacity, such as
loop flow, facility outages, level of hydropower output or seasonal limits
on energy imports from out-of-state, or actions or behaviors that may
otherwise render the system and the ISO markets vulnerable to price
manipulation to the detriment of their efficiency.

 38. Market participants used their trade organization, the WSCC, to
share access to and use real time information, notwithstanding the fact that
its publication and use violated the  ISO's operating procedures, as set
forth in tariffs and protocols that were filed with and approved by FERC,
and by adoption made part of the contracts by  which defendants were
authorized to sell electricity to the PX.  Those tariffs and protocols
required that such data be kept confidential to prevent gaming the market
and not be used by market participants to engage in anti-competitive
behavior.
39. It has been reported in the Dow Jones Work. Com Newswire on October
19, 2000, that:
""Electricity generators may have used real-time plant activity reports from
the state's grid operator to their advantage in California's wholesale
electricity market, according to an official with the Western Systems
Coordinating Council.

 * * * * * * *

""At issue is real-time information the California Independent System
Operator provided the Western systems Coordinating Council, a governmental
[sic] organization that monitors electricity reliability in the western
U.S., about power plant activity in the state.

""The real-time information allows market participants . . . to access data
via an internet site that shows how much capacity a plant with more than 200
megawatts has online at any given moment. . . . .

""The information was intended to be used to monitor electric reliability on
the grid . . . .

""Last month, however, the ISO's attorneys alerted the WSCC that the 'data is
being used against them and to game the market,' according to Bill Commish,
director of dispatch with the WSCC.

 * * * * * *

""Commish said generators could use the information to withhold supply and
drive up power prices or to identify transmission congestion in a particular
region and use that to gouge customers.

""However, the ISO, which controls about 75% of the state's power grid and
real-time market, may have violated a FERC rule because it is required to
keep such information confidential for 90 days, an ISO attorney told the
WSCC.

""Beginning Monday, the ISO will no longer provide such information  to the
WSCC or other market participants.""

 40. Starting on or about May 22, 2000, Defendants used such real time
data to exercise market power by, among other things, reducing their output,
strategically under-bidding supply to the forward markets, and exporting
electricity from the State in order to drive up the Real Time Market price
and other market prices.  As a direct result of their improper access to and
use of this information, the price of wholesale electricity spiked sharply
upwards on May 22, 2000 and has remained at artificially inflated prices
ever since.  FERC, CPUC, and CAISO Dept. of Market Analysis, have all now
concluded that market participants should be excluded from the CAISO board.
41. As noted in the North County Times on October 19, 2000:
""A case study of San Diego County's two big power plants has concluded that
they held back from full production of electricity in June, even as prices
skyrocketed and California's power manager was scrambling for supplies to
prevent blackouts.

""To the study's author . . . the low production in San Diego county is clear
evidence that the companies that generate and trade electricity in CA were
creating an artificial shortage to drive up prices.

 * * * * * *

McCullough's hour-by-hour analysis of power output for June found that the
Encina plant in Carlsbad generated 44 percent of the megawatt hours that it
could have during periods when prices were higher than the plant's cost of
production.  The South Bay power plant in Chula Vista generated 61 percent
of what would be expected under traditional economic theory.

Economists estimate it costs $45-$55 per megawatt hour to generate
electricity at the plants. The wholesale price in June averaged $120 per
megawatt hour.

A separate analysis conducted by the North County Times revealed ""mysterious
cutbacks in Carlsbad during a heady market of sky-high prices.""

 * * ** *

""Investigators and market analysts have documented extensive evidence that
electricity traders have waited until prices rose on California's market
this summer before they would commit their power plants to production.""

""'We did see evidence of withholding in the bidding,' according to Jim
Detmers, the ISO's operations chief.""

 42. In addition, defendants used such real time information about their
competitors to improperly withhold electrical supplies from the forward
markets operated by the PX in order to take advantage of the ISO's need to
balance supply and demand in the spot market and thereby benefit from the
single price auction system by obtaining the highest price paid at any given
period.  In addition, certain defendants sold or parked electricity with
affiliates in other states in order to artificially drive up prices in the
California markets.  They then sold that electricity back into the
California markets at the artificially inflated prices they had created.
These tactics forced buyers in the California wholesale electricity market
to purchase more than 30% of their electricity needs in the inflated Spot
Market, rather than the less than 5% that should be sold in that market. The
Spot Market was solely intended to satisfy last minute fluctuations in the
demand for energy.
C. Results of Defendants' Activities
43. From late May 2000 through the present, defendants' activities have
raised wholesale electricity prices to record levels, well above the rates
that would prevail in a competitive marketplace and disproportionate to the
costs of generating that electricity.  Those prices have resulted in an
approximate tripling of electricity rates in areas served by SDG&E, where
retail rates have been deregulated and represent in large part a pass
through of SDG&E's costs for such power, which it purchases from the
defendant generators and traders through the California Power Exchange.
44. As the Market Surveillance Committee (""MSC"") of the CAISO concluded
in its September 6, 2000 Report (""the MSC Report""), during the months of May
and June 2000 revenues from the sale of ISO loads in the California energy
market were 37% and 182%, respectively, above the revenues that would have
been generated under competitive pricing conditions.    MSC Report at p. 2.
The MSC Report unambiguously concluded that market participants exercised a
""significant amount of  market power"" in the California energy markets,
beginning as early as October 1999 and increasing dramatically during the
Class Period.  Id. at pp. 4, 15, 17.
45. The average market clearing price in California's wholesale markets
during August of 2000 was $166.24/MWh under moderate load conditions,
compared with $32.31/MWh a year earlier.  While load demand conditions in
California during August 2000 were slightly higher than in August 1999, they
were similar to those during August 1998 when prices were much lower.  Peak
demand in August 2000 was lower than in August of either of the prior two
years, negating representations by industry leaders that excessive demand
caused these price increases.  Indeed, some California electricity producers
were only running at 60% of capacity during the so-called emergency periods.

 46. These price hikes have even been effect during the middle of the
night, when electricity is abundant and demand is low.  Further, prices in
November 2000, when demand for electricity is much lower than during the
summer months, continue to be substantially in excess of the prior years'
levels and in excess of the levels that should prevail in a competitive
marketplace.
47. As a result of defendants' exercise of market power, they
artificially increased prices to record levels and have obtained huge
windfall profits.  As reported in the October 17, 2000 San Diego Union
Tribune,  analyst Anatol Feygin of JP Morgan estimated that electricity
industry profits from California for the 3 months ended September 30, 2000
could reach $6 billion, even after taking into account cost increases.
Feygin stated, ""'The industry was literally at eight times the profitability
of last year . . .. that is a fortune.'""
48. Defendant Reliant has reported that its third quarter earnings will
top last year's figure by about $110 million.  Similarly, defendant Dynegy
reported an 83 percent increase in its third quarter 2000 income, as
compared to its third quarter 1999 figures.   Profits from Defendant
Dynegy's wholesale energy generating and trading division quadrupled to
$141.9 million, which represented 80 percent of Dynegy's overall profits.
""This is the most successful quarter in Dynegy's history"", reported chairman
and chief executive officer, Charles 'Chuck' Watson.  Other defendants also
obtained large windfall profits during this period.
49. Prior to deregulation, the historical cost to produce a megawatt
hour of electricity in San Diego County was approximately $23-45 per MWh.
During the Summer of 2000, defendants' conduct caused the Real Time Market
price of wholesale electricity to frequently reach $750 per MWh, resulting
in an approximate tripling of SDG&E customers' bills.
50. In its Order issued on November 1, 2000, FERC concluded that
wholesale prices of electricity in California had been at ""unjust and
unreasonable"" levels during the Summer of 2000. CAISO and CPUC responses to
the November 1st FERC order both concluded that wholesale prices during
Summer 2000 were due to a substantial exercise of market power by generators
and traders.
 51. Plaintiffs and the class were injured by the manipulated and
inflated prices paid for wholesale electricity, including retail customers
of SDG&E since costs were fully passed through to them.  The CPUC's November
22, 2000 report to FERC concluded that the exercise of market power by
wholesale producers resulted in a $4 billion dollar overcharge for the
delivery of electricity to California during the summer of 2000.  Due to the
unlawful conduct alleged above, plaintiffs and the class paid approximately
$4 billion dollars more for electricity than they otherwise would have,
causing great hardship to numerous individuals and businesses. As
Congressman Brian Bilbray stated: ""Every day that goes by you've got small
businesses bleeding to death.  People are literally dying financially from
this situation.""  Work.com Newswire (10/21/00).
52. The improper sharing and use of real time wholesale electricity
generation and transmission data by defendants to withhold generation by
unplanned outages and to maintain bidding strategies which led to contrived
and artificial shortages, and other manipulative conduct, had the effect of
artificially inflating and maintaining wholesale electricity prices above
competitive prices allowing defendants to reap illegal profits amounting to
billions of dollars, at the expense of plaintiffs and the class.
 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
 Violation of Sections 16720 and 16726
 of the California Business and Professions Code
 Trust In Restraint of Trade or Commerce in Violation of the
Antitrust Act
 (Against All Defendants)

53. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
54. The Cartwright Act states, at o16726, that: ""Except as provided in
this chapter, every trust is unlawful, against public policy and void.""  A
trust is defined at o16720 as follows:
55. ""A trust is a combination of capital, skill or acts by two or more
persons for any of the following purposes:
(a) To create or carry out restrictions in trade or commerce.

(b) To limit or reduce the production, or increase the price of
merchandise or of any commodity.

(c) To prevent competition in manufacturing, making, transportation,
sale or purchase of merchandise, produce or any commodity.

(d) To fix at any standard or figure, whereby its price to the public or
consumer shall be in any manner controlled or established, any article or
commodity of merchandise, produce or commerce intended for sale, barter, use
or consumption in this State.

(e) To make or enter into or execute or carry out any contracts,
obligations, or agreements of any kind or description, by which they do all
or any or any combination of the following:

 (1) Bind themselves not to sell, dispose of or transport any article or
any commodity or any article of trade, use, merchandise, commerce or
consumption below a common standard figure, or fixed value.

(2) Agree in any manner to keep the price of such article, commodity or
transportation at a fixed or graduated figure.

(3) Establish or settle the price of any article, commodity or
transportation between them or themselves and others, so as directly or
indirectly to preclude a free and unrestricted competition among themselves,
or any purchasers or consumers in the sale or transportation of any such
article or commodity.

(4) Agree to pool, combine or directly or indirectly unite any interests
that they may have connected with the sale or transportation of any such
article or commodity, that its price might in any manner be affected.""

56. Plaintiffs and the Class are empowered by the Cartwright Act o16750
to commence a private action for up to three times their damages and
equitable relief due to the injuries they have suffered and continue to
suffer as a result of defendants' violations of the Antitrust Act.  The
Cartwright Act states:
Any person who is injured in his or her business or property by reason of
anything forbidden or declared unlawful by this chapter, may sue therefore
. . . and to recover three times the damages sustained by him or her,
interest . . . and preliminary or permanent injunctive relief . . . .

57. Plaintiffs and the Class, are ""persons"" within the meaning of the
Antitrust Act as defined in o16702.
58. Beginning on or about May 22, 2000, the exact date being presently
unknown to Plaintiffs, Defendants embarked on a conspiracy to make available
and use confidential real time industry data as to electrical generating,
power plant capacity, utilization, and outages through the WSCC, an
organization consisting of Defendants, and others, to inflate the market
prices of wholesale electricity, in restraint of trade and commerce in
California. As a result of these efforts, Defendants engaged in acts and
entered into Agreements, which  were intended to and have in fact restrained
trade and commerce in the California Power Exchange and other electricity
markets, in violation of the Antitrust Act, which violations are continuing
to the present day.
 59. The aforesaid acts, contracts, agreements, combinations and
conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce have consisted of continuing
agreements, undertakings and concert of action among Defendants, the
substantial terms of which were to artificially limit the supply of
electricity to the California markets.  Through these acts and Agreements,
Defendants acted to set, raise and maintain the prices of electricity on the
Real Time Imbalance Market and other markets to wholesale purchasers of
electricity, and, indirectly and ultimately, to California consumers, at
supra-competitive prices.
60. Defendants successfully set, raised and maintained supra-competitive
wholesale prices for electricity beginning on May 22, 2000, to the customers
of the California Power Exchange.
61. Such overcharges were paid by consumers of electricity, such as
Plaintiff and the Class she seeks to represent.
62. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, combinations and
conspiracies were intended to restrain and did, in fact, restrain trade and
commerce in California during the Class Period.
63. Defendants' unlawful restraints of trade have had and, unless
enjoined, threaten to continue to have the following anti-competitive
effects, among others:
(a) Prices charged by Defendants for electricity to wholesale
purchasers, and, ultimately, to the customers of SDG&E in California have
been and will continue to be set, raised and maintained at artificially high
and non-competitive levels;

(b) Fair and equitable price competition for the supply of electricity
and retail and wholesale price levels for electricity have been restrained
and adversely affected; and

(c) Plaintiff and other Class members have been deprived of the benefit
of free and open competition in the electricity market in California.

64. As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein,
Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to
be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open
competition, and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and
will continue to be damaged by their respective purchases and/or charges for
electricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid, absent
Defendants' unlawful conduct.
65. Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their
irreparable injuries.
66. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, conspiracies, and
combinations in restraint of trade violate the Antitrust Act.  Accordingly,
Plaintiff and the Class seek three times their damages caused by Defendants'
violations of the Antitrust Act and a permanent injunction enjoining
Defendants' continuing violations of the Cartwright Act.
/ / /
 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act
Based Upon Violations of the Antitrust Act
(against all defendants)

67. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
68. The Unfair Trade Practices Act prohibits all unfair competition,
which is defined as ""any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or
practice,"" and includes violations of the Cartwright Act,  oo16700 et seq.
of the B&P Code.
69. As alleged hereinabove, beginning as early as May, 2000, defendants
unlawfully conspired, agreed, arranged and combined to prevent and restrain
competition for the sale of electricity, in violation of oo 16700 et seq.
and oo 17200 et seq. of the B&P Code.
70. Pursuant to B&P Code oo 17200 et seq., Plaintiff brings this action
seeking injunctive relief to enjoin defendants' unfair trade practices and
requiring defendants' disgorgement of all monies obtained by virtue of their
violations of the Cartwright Act as described hereinabove.
71. As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein,
Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue to
be unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and open
competition, and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged and
will continue to be damaged by their respective purchases and/or charges for
electricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid, absent
defendants' unlawful conduct.
72. Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for their
irreparable injuries.
73. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, conspiracies, and
combinations in restraint of trade and free and open competition, alleged
herein, violate the Antitrust Act.  Accordingly, Plaintiff and the Class
seek restitution and disgorgement by defendants to the Class of all monies
obtained by defendants' acts of unfair competition with respect to the
contract, conspiracy, combination and trust, and a permanent injunction

 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
For Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act
Based Upon Defendants' Unfair Business Acts and Practices
In Charging Unjust and Unreasonable Rates
(against all defendants)

74. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
75. Section 17200 et seq. of the California Business & Professions Code
prohibits acts of unfair competition, which include any ""unlawful, unfair,
or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or
misleading advertising"".
76. The Defendants consistently engaged in numerous acts of  ""unfair
competition"", as more fully described above, by inter alia, manipulating the
price of wholesale electricity in the California markets.
77. In addition, pursuant to the Federal Power Act:
""All rates and charges made, demanded, or received by any public utility for
or in connection with the transmission or sale of electric energy subject to
the jurisdiction of the Commission . . . shall be just and reasonable and
any such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is hereby declared
to be unlawful.""

16 U.S.C. Section 824d(a).

78. Defendants are public utilities within the term as used in the
foregoing statute.
79. The FERC has specifically found that the prices defendants charged
for the wholesale electricity they sold in the California markets during the
Class Period were in fact unjust and unreasonable.  The California Public
Utilities Commission has determined that said unjust and unreasonable prices
resulted from the exercise of market power by generators and traders in the
California wholesale electricity market.
80. As a result of the conduct described above, the  defendants
unlawfully acquired money and property from Plaintiff and the Class and have
been and will be unjustly enriched at the expense of Plaintiff and the
members of the Class.  Specifically, defendants have deprived Plaintiff and
the Class of billions of dollars in monies from the sale of electricity at
unjust, excessive, and manipulated prices.
/ / /
 81. Pursuant to Section 17203 of the California Business & Professions
Code, Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court
restoring to them all money wrongfully taken from them and allowing them a
claim in the full amount of all of defendants' ill-gotten gains, so as to
restore any and all monies to Plaintiff and the members of the Class and the
general public, which were acquired and obtained by means of such unfair and
deceptive acts and practices.
82. Pursuant to Section 17203 of the California Business & Professions
Code, Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Court
providing appropriate equitable and/or injunctive relief restraining
defendants from charging unjust and unreasonable rates and from manipulating
the electricity markets.
 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
 Violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act
 (Against All Defendants)

83. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
84. Such acts and practices by defendants violate the Consumer Legal
Remedies Act, Civil Code Section 1750, et seq.  Defendants' acts warrant
appropriate injunctive and declaratory relief, including an injunction
restraining them from charging unjust and unfair rates or manipulating the
market for electricity.
FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION
Unconscionability
(Against All Defendants)

85. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every
allegation set forth above.
86. Defendants charged rates for wholesale electricity that were
unconscionable given their cost of production, the newly emergent markets
for that product, and the consumers' need for electrical power.
87. Defendants' rates were  inherently  excessive, invalid and
unconscionable, particularly in light of the deceptive and manipulative
practices they used to inflate the market prices and the vital need
consumers and businesses have for electrical power.
/ / /
 88. Defendants' unconscionable prices were passed through to Plaintiff
and the majority of the Class in the retail electricity rates charged by
SDG&E and thereby directly damaged Plaintiff and the Class.
 VI.
 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff and the Class pray for judgment against defendants as
follows:
(a) That the Court determine that this action may be maintained as a
class action and direct that reasonable  notice of this action be given to
the members of the Class;
(b) That the combination, contract, arrangement, agreement, conspiracy
and trust alleged herein be adjudged and decreed to be an unreasonable
restraint of trade in violation of Sections 16720 and 16726 of the
California Business and Professions Code;
(c) That damages be granted according to proof, and that Plaintiff and
the Class be awarded treble damages or statutory damages, where applicable,
attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements;
(d) That Plaintiff and the Class be awarded pre- and post-judgment
interest;
(e) That the Court enter appropriate injunctive and other equitable
relief, including the disgorgement of defendants' unlawful profits; and
(f) That Plaintiff and the Class have such other and further relief as
the Court may deem just and proper under the circumstances.
